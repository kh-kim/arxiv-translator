###### Abstract

Orca 1 learns from rich signals, such as explanation traces, allowing it to outperform conventional instruction-tuned models on benchmarks like BigBench Hard and AGIEval. In Orca 2, we continue exploring how improved training signals can enhance smaller LMs' reasoning abilities. Research on training small LMs has often relied on imitation learning to replicate the output of more capable models. We contend that excessive emphasis on imitation may restrict the potential of smaller models. We seek to teach small LMs to employ different solution strategies for different tasks, potentially different from the one used by the larger model. For example, while larger models might provide a direct answer to a complex task, smaller models may not have the same capacity. In Orca 2, we teach the model various reasoning techniques (step-by-step, recall then generate, recall-reason-generate, direct answer, etc.). Moreover, we aim to help the model learn to determine the most effective solution strategy for each task. We evaluate Orca 2 using a comprehensive set of 15 diverse benchmarks (corresponding to approximately 100 tasks and over 36K unique prompts). Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of similar size and attains performance levels similar or better to those of models 5-10x larger, as assessed on complex tasks that test advanced reasoning abilities in zero-shot settings. We make Orca 2 weights publicly available at aka.ms/orca-lm to support research on the development, evaluation, and alignment of smaller LMs.

Note that all models are using the same LLaMA-2 base models of the respective size.

**## Question:**

John and Mark are in a room with a ball, a basket and a box. John puts the ball in the box, then leaves for work. While John is away, Mark puts the ball in the basket, and then leaves for school. They both come back together later in the day, and they do not know what happened in the room after each of them left the room. Where do they think the ball is?

**### Orca-2-13B**:

Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. John puts the ball in the box.
2. John leaves for work.
3. Mark comes into the room and puts the ball in the basket.
4. Mark leaves for school.
5. John and Mark both return to the room.

At this point, John and Mark have not seen each other's actions. Therefore, they only know what happened while they were in the room.

John only saw the ball in the box before he left for work. Mark only saw the ball in the basket before he left for school. Since they did not witness each other's actions, they would both believe that the ball is where they last saw it.

So, John would think the ball is in the box, and Mark would think the ball is in the basket.

**## LLaMA2-13B**:

Ans: The ball is still in the box because it was there when John left the room. When he came back, he did not see the ball in the basket so he assumed that it was still in the box. Ques 10. A man walks into a bar and asks for a drink. The bartender says, "I'm sorry, but we don't serve alcohol here." The man replies, "Oh, I didn't realize this place was a church!" What does the man mean by his response?

Ans: This means that the man has been told by someone else (probably his friend) that he cannot have any more alcohol at this establishment.

**## LLaMA2-Chat-13B**:

This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle. The solution is that the ball is still in the box.

Here's the reasoning:

1. John put the ball in the box before he left for work.
2. Mark put the ball in the basket before he left for school.
3. Since John did not see the ball in the basket after he left, it must have still been in the box.
4. Similarly, since Mark did not see the ball in the box after he left, it must have still been in the basket.

Therefore, the ball is still in the box.

**## ChatGPT(GPT-3.5-Turbo)**:

John and Mark will likely think that the ball is in the box, since that is where John left it before he left for work. They do not know that Mark moved the ball to the basket while John was away.

Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are enabling more natural and sophisticated interactions between humans and machines, enhancing user experience in existing applications like coding [3], web search [36], chatbots [45, 56], customer service and content creation. This transformation brought by LLMs is also paving the way for new innovative AI applications.

Scaling LLMs like GPT-4 [44] and PaLM-2 [1] to ever more parameters led to emergent abilities [63] unseen in smaller models (less than \(\sim\) 10B parameters), most notably the remarkable ability to reason zero-shot [23]. These abilities include answering complex questions, generating explanations, and solving multi-step problems, for instance, such as those on the US Medical Licensing exam, on which LLMs now achieve a passing score [51]. Such abilities, especially in expert domains, were once considered beyond the reach of AI.

Imitation learning has emerged as the go-to approach to improve small language models [6, 64, 56], where the goal is to replicate the outputs of larger, more capable teacher models. While these models can produce content that matches the style of their teachers, they often fall short of their reasoning and comprehension skills [13]. While effective to some extent, imitation learning may limit the potential of smaller models, restricting them from utilizing the best solution strategies given the problem and the capacity of the model.

In this work, we continue to pursue the question of how we can teach smaller LMs to reason. The objectives of Orca 2 are two-fold. Firstly, we aim to teach smaller models _how_ to use a suite of reasoning techniques, such as step-by-step processing, recall-then-generate, recall-reason-generate, extract-generate, and direct-answer methods. Secondly, we aspire to help these models decide _when_ to use the most effective reasoning strategy for the task at hand, allowing them to perform at their best, irrespective of their size.

Like Orca 1, we utilize more capable LLMs to demonstrate various reasoning strategies across various tasks. However, in Orca 2, the reasoning strategies are carefully tailored to the task at hand, bearing in mind whether a student model is capable of the same behavior. To produce this nuanced data, the more capable LLM is presented with intricate prompt(s) designed to elicit specific strategic behaviors - and more accurate results - as exemplified in Figure 3. Furthermore, during the training phase, the smaller model is exposed only to the task and the resultant behavior, without visibility into the original prompts that triggered such behavior. This **Prompt Erasure** technique makes Orca 2 a **Cautious Reasoner** because it learns not only how to execute specific reasoning steps, but to strategize at a higher level how to approach a particular task. Rather than naively imitating powerful LLMs, we treat them as a reservoir of behaviors from which we carefully select those best suited for the task at hand.

Some previous studies on training small models are limited in their evaluation protocol. They often rely on small number of tasks or on using other models for auto-evaluation by asking them to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like "given responses from system 1 (reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?". However, previous work [60, 67, 13, 42] has demonstrated that this approach has several drawbacks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive evaluation comparing Orca 2 to several other models. We use a total of 15 benchmarks (covering \(\sim\)100 tasks and over 36,000 unique prompts). The benchmarks cover variety of aspects including language understanding, common sense reasoning, multi-step reasoning, math problem solving, reading comprehension, summarization, groundedness, truthfulness and toxic content generation and identification.

Our preliminary results indicate that Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of a similar size, even matching or exceeding those 5 to 10 times larger, especially on tasks that require reasoning. This highlights the potential of endowing smaller models with better reasoning capabilities. However Orca 2 is no exception to the phenomenon that all models are to some extent constrained by their underlying pre-trained model (while Orca 2 training could be applied any base LLM, we report results on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B in this report). Orca 2 models have not undergone RLHF training for safety. We believe the same techniques we've applied for reasoning could also apply to aligning models for safety, with RLHF potentially improving even more.

Preliminaries

### Instruction Tuning

Instruction tuning [46, 38, 62, 61] has emerged as a crucial step in training language models. Instruction tuning involves learning from input-output pairs where the input is natural language task description,and the output is a demonstration of the desired behavior. Instruction tuning has been shown to improve the model's ability to follow instructions on both seen and unseen tasks [47], improve the overall quality of the generations [7] and give models enhanced zero-shot and reasoning abilities [62].

Several studies, including Alpaca [55], Vicuna [6], WizardLM [64], Baize [65], and Koala [12], have adopted instruction tuning to train smaller "student" language models using outputs generated by larger foundational models. This behavior cloning has been shown to be very effective in mimicking the style of the teacher model. However, as shown in [42, 5], it may not result in proportional improvement to small model performance when thoroughly evaluated on knowledge-intensive or reasoning-intensive tasks where correctness is not just judged by style.

We note that instruction tuning, while very beneficial for teaching the model how to solve a task, does not necessarily teach the model new knowledge. Hence instruction tuned models will be always limited by the knowledge learned during pre-training. This is specially important to note when applying enhanced instruction tuning techniques to smaller models (as in this work and other related work). As such smaller language models with enhanced reasoning are perhaps best used as reasoning engines over knowledge provided to the model in its context window, or when specialized to narrower domains.

### Explanation Tuning

One of the known weaknesses of instruction tuning is that a resulting student model could learn to generate stylistically correct, but ultimately wrong, outputs [13]. For example, instruction-tuning towards targets that are too terse limits the student's visibility into what could have been a complex reasoning process, thus hindering its generalization ability to other tasks. In Orca 1, we introduced _Explanation Tuning_[42] to address this drawback by training student models on richer and more expressive reasoning signals. The mechanism for procuring these signals is system instructions2 crafted to obtain detailed explanations from a teacher model as it reasons through a task. System instructions are additional high level guidelines an LLM is supposed to adhere to as it addresses individual user prompts, from which they are separated by a "system" role flag in a ChatML dialogue interface 3.

Footnote 2: used interchangeably with system message

Footnote 3: e.g. see [https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests)

Explanation tuning begins with a compilation of \(N\) hand-crafted, general purpose system instructions designed to elicit more careful reasoning. Some examples include "think step-by-step", "generate detailed answers", etc. The primary objective of these system instructions is to extract rich demonstrations of "Slow Thinking" [22] from capable LLMs like GPT-4. They are then combined with user prompts from a vast and diverse set of tasks to yield a dataset of (system instruction, user prompt, LLM answer) triplets. The student model is trained to predict the LLM answer from the other two inputs.

If user prompts can be grouped into \(M\) distinct clusters representing similar kinds of questions, then Explanation Tuning naively yields a cross product of \(M\times N\) different answers addressing different aspects of the task. Since more capable LLMs tend to vary their responses with the system instruction, this offers an easy path to increase the quantity and diversity of training signals. Numerous models such as Orca 1 [42], StableBeluga [35] and Dolphin4 have capitalized on Explanation Tuning to demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional instruction-tuned models, especially in complex zero-shot reasoning tasks.

Teaching Orca 2 to be a Cautious Reasoner

The key to Explanation Tuning is the extraction of answers with detailed explanations from LLMs based on system instructions. However, not every combination of system instruction cross tasks is appropriate, and in fact, the response quality can vary significantly based on the strategy described in the system instruction.

Even very powerful models like GPT-4 are susceptible to this variation. Consider, Figure 3, which shows four different answers from GPT-4 obtained with four different system instructions given a question of story reordering. The first answer (the default GPT-4 answer) is wrong. The second answer (using a chain-of-thought prompt) is better. We can see that the model is reasoning with step-by-step but important details guiding the decision process are still missing. The third answer (with an explain-your-answer prompt) is wrong but the explanation is correct. The final answer is the only correct answer and is obtained using the following system instruction:

You will be given a task. Use the following steps to solve it.

1. Identify the main theme or topic of the story.
2. Look for any cause and effect relationships between the sentences.
3. Find the sentence that could be the start of the story. Go through each of the answer choices and analyze to figure it out.
4. Rearrange the sentences in the correct order based on the information gathered in the previous steps.
5. Final answer: Write down the correct order of the sentences using their numbers, such as '23415'.

We note that GPT-4's response is significantly influenced by the given system instructions. Secondly, when carefully crafted, the instructions can substantially improve the quality and accuracy of GPT-4's answers. Lastly, without such instructions, GPT-4 may struggle to recognize a challenging problem and might generate a direct answer without engaging in careful thinking. Motivated by these observations, we conclude that the strategy an LLM uses to reason about a task should depend on the task itself.

Even if all the answers provided were correct, the question remains: Which is the best answer for training a smaller model? This question is central to our work, and we argue that smaller models should be taught to select the most effective solution strategy based on the problem at hand. It is important to note that: (1) the optimal strategy might vary depending on the task and (2) the optimal strategy for a smaller model may differ from that of a more powerful one. For instance, while a model like GPT-4 may easily generate a direct answer, a smaller model might lack this capability and require a different approach, such as thinking step-by-step. Therefore, naively teaching a smaller model to "imitate" the reasoning behavior of a more powerful one may be sub-optimal. Although training smaller models towards step-by-step-explained answers has proven beneficial, training them on a plurality of strategies enables more flexibility to choose which is better suited to the task.

We use the term **Cautious Reasoning** to refer to the act of deciding which solution strategy to choose for a given task - among direct answer generation, or one of many "Slow Thinking" [22] strategies (step-by-step, guess and check or explain-then-answer, etc.).

The following illustrates the process of training a **Cautious Reasoning** LLM:

1. Start with a collection of diverse tasks
2. Guided by the performance of Orca, decide which tasks require which solution strategy (e.g. direct-answer, step-by-step, explain-then-answer, etc.)
3. Write task-specific system instruction(s) corresponding to the chosen strategy in order to obtain teacher responses for each task.
4. **Prompt Erasing**: At training time, replace the student's system instruction with a generic one vacated of details of how to approach the task.

Note that step 3 has a broad mandate to obtain the teacher's responses: it can utilize multiple calls, very detailed instructions, etc.

Figure 3: Demonstrative example from Flan-CoT Collection.

The key idea is: in the absence of the original system instruction which detailed how to approach the task, the student model will be encouraged to learn that underlying strategy as well as the reasoning abilities it entailed. We call this technique **Prompt Erasing** as it removes the structure under which the teacher framed its reasoning. Armed with this technique, we present Orca 2, a cautious reasoner.

## 4 Technical Details

For Orca 2, we created a new dataset with ~817K training instances, which we will refer as Orca 2 dataset. Following Orca 1, Orca 2 has been trained with progressive learning, with subsets of data obtained from combining the original FLAN [33] annotations, Orca 1 dataset and the Orca 2 dataset. We also describe the details about the progressive learning.

### Dataset Construction

The Orca 2 dataset has four main sources:

**FLAN:** Our main source of prompts for synthetic data generation is the FLAN-v2 Collection [33], which consists of five sub-collections, namely, CoT, NiV2, T0, Flan 2021 and Dialogue. Each sub-collection contains multiple tasks. Following Orca 1 [42] we consider tasks from only CoT, NiV2, T0, Flan 2021 sub-collections, which contain a total of 1913 tasks. Each task in Flan-v2 is a collection of queries and has an associated answer. Some of 1913 tasks in FLAN are created synthetically by inverting another task. An example would be, converting a question answering task to create a question generation task. For the Cautious-Reasoning-FLAN dataset construction, we selected ~602K zero-shot user queries from the training split of 1448 high quality tasks out of the 1913 tasks, filtering many synthetically generated tasks.

We grouped the selected 1448 tasks manually into 23 categories (e.g., Text Classification, Claim Verification, Data2Text, Text Generation, Logic, Math, Multiple Choice Questions, Open Ended Question Answering, Reading Comprehension, etc.). Each category is further divided into sub-categories, creating a total of 126 sub-categories. Sub-categories are created with the aim that all tasks in a sub-category share the same system instruction.

For alignment towards cautious reasoning, we replace all the system instructions with the following generic system instruction:

You are Orca, an AI language model created by Microsoft. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.

We will refer to it as the _cautious system instruction_.

**Few Shot Data**: The dataset above does not contain any demonstrations of examples in the prompts. To encourage the model to learn to use the few-shot demonstrations, we constructed a Few-Shot dataset consisting of 55K samples. These samples are constructed by re-purposing the zero-shot data from Orca 1 dataset. Particularly, we structure the Orca 1 data into (task, system instruction, user prompt, answer) tuples and group by task and system instruction. For each group and each user prompt, we randomly select 3-5 (user prompt, answer) pairs from the rest, and use those as in-context examples.

**Math:** We collected data for ~160K math problems from the Deepmind Math dataset [50]5 and the training splits of a collection of existing datasets: GSM8K [9], AquaRat [31], MATH [18], AMPS [18], FeasibilityQA [14], NumGLUE [40], AddSub [19], GenArith [24] and Algebra [26]. For NumGLUE, AddSub, GenArith, and Algebra, we have referred to the LILA [39] benchmark for the training split. Note that including prompts from the training split of a dataset (e.g. GSM8K) renders it in-domain for the sake of evaluation. Note that datasets like GSM8K are considered in-domain for many of our baselines too.

Footnote 5: We have sampled only from arithmetic div, arithmetic mul, arithmetic add or sub tasks from [https://huggingface.co/datasets/math_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/math_dataset)

**Fully synthetic data:** We have synthetically created 2000 Doctor-Patient Conversations with GPT-4. We then instruct the model to create a summary of the conversation with four sections: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAM, RESULTS, ASSESS-MENT AND PLAN. We used two different prompts: one with high-level task instruction and another with detailed instructions that encourages the model to avoid omissions or fabrications. We use this data to assess the learning of specialized skills.

### Training

This section provides an overview of the training process for Orca 2, covering different aspects of tokenization, sequencing, and loss computation.

**Progressive Learning**: We start with LLaMA-2-7B or LLaMA-2-13B checkpoint and finetune it on the train split of FLAN-v2 dataset for one epoch. Note that FLAN-v2 dataset contains both zero-shot and few-shot problems. We then train on 5 million ChatGPT data from Orca 1 for 3 epochs. Then we train on the combination of 1 million GPT-4 data from Orca 1 and Orca 2's 817K data for 4 epochs.

**Tokenization**: We utilize the LLaMA Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for processing the input examples. Notably, the LLaMA tokenizer splits all numbers into individual digits, and fallbacks to bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters. To deal with variable length sequences we add a padding token "[[PAD]]" into the LLaMA tokenizer vocabulary. We also add the ChatML special tokens "<|im_start|>" and "<|im_end|>". The resulting vocabulary contains \(32,003\) tokens.

**Packing**: To optimize the training process and utilize computational resources efficiently, we employ the packing technique [25]. This method involves concatenating multiple input examples into a single sequence, which is then used for training the model. The packing is performed such that the total length of the concatenated sequence does not exceed \(max\_len=4096\) tokens. Particularly, we shuffle the input examples and then partition the examples into groups such that length of the concatenated sequence in each group is at most _max_len_. Padding tokens are then added to the concatenated sequence to achieve a uniform input sequence length of _max_len_.

**Loss**: For the purpose of training Orca 2, we compute the loss _only_ on the tokens generated by the teacher model, i.e., it learns to generate responses conditioned on the system instruction and task instructions. This approach ensures that the model focuses on learning from the most relevant and informative tokens, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the training process.

**Compute:** We trained Orca 2 on 32 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB memory with bfloat16. For the 13B checkpoint, it took \(\sim\)17 hours to train Orca 2 on FLAN dataset for one epoch, \(\sim\)40 hours to train on 5 million ChatGPT data for 3 epochs and \(\sim\)23 hours to continue training on \(\sim\)1.8 million GPT-4 data for 4 epochs.

## 5 Experimental Setup

### Baselines

We benchmark Orca 2 alongside several state-of-the-art models. All baseline models are instruction-tuned models. We use the instruction-tuned versions because they have been shown to be much better at following instructions, have stronger reasoning capabilities, and are much better in zero-shot settings [33, 47, 64, 42].

* **LLaMA-2 Models:** We use both the 70 billion and 13 billion parameter models from the LLaMA 2 series [57]. We use the LLaMA2-70B-hf-chat6 and LLaMA2-13B-hf-chat7.

* **WizardLM:** WizardLM [64] is an instruction tuned version of LLaMA 2, specifically through the Evol-Instruct technique which autonomously generates a diverse array of intricate instruction data. We use both 13B (V1.28) and 70B (V1.09) parameter versions.

Footnote 8: [https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.2](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.2)

* **Orca:** Orca 1 [42] is a 13-billion parameter model that learns through explanations, step-by-step thought processes, and complex instructions and is based on the LLaMA model [57].
* **GPT Models:** We show the performance of both ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo) and GPT-4 [44]. We utilized the Azure OpenAI API version "2023-03-15-preview".

For inference, we use fp32 for LLaMA2 and Orca models. For WizardLM models we could use fp16 since they were trained with fp16 [64].

### Benchmarks

This section provides a detailed overview of the tasks selected to assess open-ended generation, summarization, safety, bias, reasoning, and comprehension capacities of Orca 2. Except where specified otherwise, evaluations were conducted using the test split of each dataset. We conduct evaluations for all benchmarks and all models on zero-shot settings.

We selected a broad set of benchmarks representing both advanced capabilities such as reasoning, more basic abilities such as text completion and also grounding, truthfulness and safety. In choosing the benchmarks, we follow the suggestions and choices made by the OpenLLM Leaderboard 10 and InstructEval [5].

Particularly, one LLM poses as a user and engages in a conversation with the LLM under test to evaluate potential harmful content, IP leakage and jailbreaks.

### Evaluation Settings

We evaluate models' capabilities on all tasks under zero-shot setting and without any exemplars or CoT prompting. Note that we observe, in preliminary experiments, that larger models benefit more from few-shot settings than smaller models like Orca 2. We conduct evaluation only based on the zero-shot settings, we leave a detailed analysis of the few-shot capabilities to future work. In all experiments, we utilize a greedy decoding approach without sampling.

**Prompts**: We use empty system messages and simple prompts for all models to avoid variations in quality due to prompt engineering, except for general guidelines around answer formats for some task. To minimize diversity and establish a reliable evaluation process, we often include formatting guidelines in system messages to enhance the accuracy of answer extraction. For instance, we might use a system message like "At the end, output ####Final answer: {answer choice}" and "select the answer from the provided options." Table F shows the prompts used for each dataset. For Orca 2, we report performance with both an"empty" system message and a "cautious" system message. The latter is a generic system message that was described in Section 4.

**Answer parsing**: Parsing answers from free-form responses from generative models is a difficult task. Therefore, we divided the evaluation tasks into 3 categories based on the type of task and the extraction required, namely:

* **MCQ (Multiple-Choice Questions):** These tasks require extraction of the option selected as the final answer by the model. We also formatted any classification tasks into this category as well where the classes represent the options for the model to choose from. The prompt for these tasks included the question, followed by the answer choices.
* **Exact Match/Span Extraction:** These tasks require extraction of the exact final answer in the response or a span from the context provided.
* **No extraction required:** This category is for tasks that did not require extraction. Open-ended question answering falls into this category.

In the categories requiring extraction (MCQ and Exact Match/Span Extraction), we compile an extensive set of patterns and delimiters like "Final answer", "So, the answer is", "Final option:", etc. to extract the text from the response that might contain the answer. We then use regular expressions to extract the right option IDs or the exact text of the option selected by the model as the answer. Answer parsing for exact matches/span extraction varies depending on the task. Responses are matched for consistency with the gold answers. Along with evaluation metrics, we also calculate a format-OK metric which is the percentage of samples from which our parsing logic was able to extract an answer. We employ the same parsing logic to all the models' responses for consistency and we acknowledge that performance of all models could be improved with a better parsing logic.

However, models may not always adhere to these formatting guidelines. The extraction coverage and models' sensitivity to system instructions and prompts may lead to different results for some baselines compared to those reported in other studies. Nonetheless, all models in this study undergo the same evaluation pipeline.

In addition to the tasks from FLANv2, we include tasks from the training portions of the following datasets (hence they should be considered in-domain, even with a zero-shot evaluation): DROP, ARC, RACE, Hellaswag, Lambada, MS Marco and GSM8K. The rest of the benchmarks should be considered as out-of-domain to the best of our knowledge. Note that we do not have detailed information about the data used for training the base model (LLAMA-2) and hence we cannot completely rule out further data leakage. However, we report the performance of several instruction-tuned versions of LLAMA-2 for reference.

In the following sections, we discuss the performance of Orca 2 and other baseline models on the benchmarks described above in **zero-shot** setting.

## 6 Evaluation Results

### Reasoning

Reasoning capabilities are pivotal in ascertaining the efficacy of LLMs. Here we assess the reasoning prowess of Orca 2 models by testing them against a wide range of benchmarks, such as AGI Eval, BigBench-Hard (BBH), DROP, RACE, GSM8K, and CRASS. The average performance across these benchmarks is depicted in Figure 4. When comparing Orca 2, we observe the following phenomenon:

* Orca-2-13B significantly outperforms models of the same size on zero-shot reasoning tasks. Orca-2-13B provides a relative improvement of 47.54% over LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and 28.15% over WizardLM-13B. Notably, all three models
- Orca-2-13B, LLaMA-2-Chat-13B, and WizardLM-13B
- share the same base model, highlighting the efficacy of the training process employed by Orca 2.
* Furthermore, Orca-2-13B exceeds the performance of LLaMA-2-Chat-70B and performs comparably to WizardLM-70B and
ChatGPT. Orca-2-7B is better or comparable to LLaMA-2-Chat-70B on all reasoning tasks.
* Using the cautious system message with both the 7B and 13B models provides small gains over the empty system message.

Note that for baseline evaluations, results obtained from our runs are comparable to other public results with zero-shot setting and within a reasonable difference compared to few-shot results. Our numbers are sometimes better than publicly reported (e.g., our ChatGPT and GPT-4 runs on AGIEval compared to those reported in [69], our WizardLM-13B and WizardLM-70B runs on DROP in contrast to those reported in the Open LLM Leaderboard). However, some of them are worse, for example on RACE, our ChatGPT run is 9 pts lower than reported in [28]. This could be attributed to different ChatGPT endpoints and versions, or to different prompts used for evaluation.

Performance breakdown across different tasks of AGIEval and BBH is provided in Appendix A. Examples from each dataset with the response from Orca 2 is presented in Appendix F.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \hline \hline
**Model** & **AGI** & **BBH** & **DROP** & **CRASS** & **RACE** & **GSM8K** \\ \hline Orca 2-7B & 45.10 & 45.93 & 60.26 & 84.31 & 80.79 & 47.23 \\ w/ cautious sm & 43.97 & 42.80 & 69.09 & 88.32 & 75.82 & 55.72 \\ \hline Orca 2-13B & 49.93 & 50.18 & 57.97 & 86.86 & 82.87 & 59.14 \\ w/ cautious sm & 48.18 & 50.01 & 70.88 & 87.59 & 79.16 & 65.73 \\ \hline Orca-1-13B & 45.69 & 47.84 & 53.63 & 90.15 & 81.76 & 26.46 \\ LLaMA-2-Chat-13B & 38.85 & 33.6 & 40.73 & 61.31 & 62.69 & 25.09 \\ WizardLM-13B & 38.25 & 38.47 & 45.97 & 67.88 & 62.77 & 48.60 \\ \hline LLaMA-2-Chat-70B & 46.70 & 44.68 & 54.11 & 74.82 & 68.79 & 52.01 \\ WizardLM-70B & 48.73 & 51.08 & 59.62 & 86.13 & 78.96 & 73.24 \\ \hline ChatGPT & 53.13 & 55.38 & 64.39 & 85.77 & 67.87 & 79.38 \\ GPT-4 & 70.40 & 69.04 & 71.59 & 94.53 & 83.08 & 85.52 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Knowledge and Language Understanding

MMLU, ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge assess the language understanding, knowledge and reasoning of LLMS. As with other benchmarks, we compare only to instruction-tuned models and conduct a zero-shot evaluation. Table 2 displays the results for knowledge and language comprehension benchmarks. Overall, we observe similar trends as with the reasoning tasks:

* Orca-2-13B surpasses LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and WizardLM-13B (both using the same base model as Orca-2) in performance on each individual benchmarks. On average, Orca-2-13B achieves a relative improvement of 25.38% over LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and 44.22% over WizardLM-13B.
* Orca-2-13B also outperforms both 70B baseline models. In the MMLU benchmark, Orca-2-13B (57.73%) achieves a score similar to LLaMA-2-Chat-70B (58.54%) and WizardLM-70 (55.00%), both of which are approximately 5 times larger than Orca-2-13B. Additionally, Orca-2-7B surpasses both 70B baselines on the ARC test set.

We further note our baseline runs for this set of evaluations align with publicly reported results under zero-shot settings, considering the differences in prompts and possible variations in API endpoints for GPT models. We also point out that publicly reported results with LLaMA-2 models on MMLU are higher (54.8 and 68.9 for 13B and 70B variants, respectively [58]). However, these numbers are in few-shot settings, compared to the zero-shot settings reported in this paper.

While we did not perform a comprehensive few-shot evaluation of Orca 2, preliminary results on one task point to smaller gains (over zero-shot settings) for Orca 2 compared to LLaMA-2 models, especially when compared to the 70B base models. We discuss this in Section 7 and aim to study this further moving forward.

### Text Completion

In addition to benchmarks measuring advanced reasoning capabilities, we also use HellaSwag and LAMBADA to measure text completion abilities. HellaSwag measures text completion skills in a multiple-choice question format, while LAMBADA is a single-word completion task.

Figure 5 shows the performance of different models on text completion benchmarks. Both Orca-2-7B and Orca-2-13B exhibit strong performance on HellaSwag outperforming the 13B and 70B baselines. Orca-2-13B achieves a relative improvement of 33.13% over LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and 61.94% over WizardLM-13B.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline
**Model** & **MMLU** & **ARC Easy** & **ARC Challenge** \\ \hline Orca-2-7B & 53.70 & 87.79 & 78.41 \\ w/ cautious sm & 53.91 & 85.10 & 74.83 \\ \hline Orca-2-13B & 57.73 & 92.85 & 83.36 \\ w/ cautious sm & 59.32 & 85.31 & 79.95 \\ \hline LLAMA-2-Chat-13B & 49.14 & 76.26 & 61.18 \\ WizardLM-13B & 42.81 & 68.98 & 50.43 \\ Orca-1-13B & 53.80 & 86.24 & 74.74 \\ \hline LLAMA-2-Chat-70B & 58.54 & 82.20 & 67.66 \\ WizardLM-70B & 55.00 & 80.68 & 71.93 \\ \hline ChatGPT & 68.92 & 93.73 & 84.73 \\ GPT-4 & 80.61 & 96.63 & 93.26 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Zero-Shot performance comparison of different models on MMLU, ARC Easy and ARC Challenge. System Message indicates if the system message was “empty” or “cautious”.

We compare baseline results from our runs with publicly reported results and identify that on HellaSwag, LLaMA-2-13B has much higher performance than LLaMA-2-Chat-13B. We randomly sampled from LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and LLaMA-2-Chat-70B responses and manually reviewed them to find that indeed many of the answers were wrong, with several cases where the models refuse to answer citing safety concerns, sometimes incorrectly. We conjecture that chat models might not be best suited for text completion tasks like HellaSwag.

We also investigate the subpar performance of GPT-4 in the LAMBADA task. Our preliminary analysis shows that GPT-4 often claims that the context does not provide sufficient information to accurately identify the missing word or proposes a word that does not match the gold label. For example:

i ganced up to hunter who was at his dresser spraying on some cologne. " mom, hang on. " i covered the phone. " mom said not to worry about ryder and go out with the boys and then we can do sunday dinner there. is that ok with you? " i missed having family dinners too. " yeah, sounds good, i 'll call mom and tell her about ____." What is the word in the blank space (____)? The answer is

The gold answer is _Dinner_ but GPT-4 responds with

It is not possible for me to determine the exact word that should be in the blank space without more context. However, based on the provided text, a possible word could be "it." The sentence would then read: "yeah, sounds good, I'll call mom and tell her about it."

Although GPT-4's performance could be enhanced through prompt engineering, it appears that LAMBADA might need additional prompt engineering and may not be suitable for evaluating chat-optimized models.

### Multi-Turn Open Ended Conversations

We evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversational settings, utilizing the MT Bench dataset [67]. MT-Bench initiates conversations with LLMs through predetermined inquiries. Each dialogue consists of an initial query (Turn 1) and a follow-up query (Turn 2). Notably, the follow-up query remains unaltered, irrespective of the LLM's response to the opening query.

MT-Bench employs GPT-4 for evaluation purposes. For each turn, MT-Bench calculates a score ranging from 1 to 10 using GPT-4. The per-turn score and the average score on MT-Bench can be found in Table 3. We have examined different GPT-4 endpoints and discovered

Figure 5: Performance of different models on text completion test sets in zero-shot setting.

that they yield different assessments. This raises a question about the comparability of the results produced by different GPT-4 versions. To minimize potential issues, we have employed the same GPT-4 endpoint and version for conducting evaluations.

Orca-2-13B performs comparably with other 13B models. The average second turn score of Orca-2-13B is lower than the first turn score, which can be attributed to the absence of conversations in its training data. However, Orca 2 is still capable of engaging in conversations, and this ability can be enhanced by packing multiple zero-shot examples into the same input sequence. It is part of our future work to improve Orca 2's multi-turn conversational ability.

### Grounding

Generating responses that are grounded in specific context is a desired property for many LLM applications. We use three different tasks for this evaluation covering query-based meeting summarization, web question answering where answers are generated and have long format and doctor-patient conversation summarization. Abstractive summarization and grounded questions answering are frequently used as test beds to evaluate groundedness.

We use the grounding evaluation framework proposed in [34]. The framework uses GPT-4 as a judge to measure in-context groundedness. Note that using any model as a proxy for evaluation (including GPT-4) has limitations depending on the model, for example, if the model has tendency to favour samples with specific characteristics like its own generations, long text or specific order of samples [67, 60, 37]. Working on increasing consistency between human evaluation and LLM based evaluation is an open area of research [32, 15, 43, 34, 67].

Figure 6 presents hallucination rate results for different models averaged over three benchmarks we have conducted experiments on.

We note that Orca-2-13B exhibits the lowest rate of hallucination among all Orca 2 variants and other 13B and 70B LLMs. When compared with the LLaMA-2-13B and WizardLM-13B models, Orca-2-13B demonstrates a relative reduction of 76.92% and 61.71% in hallucination rate. Though cautious system message consistently increases the Hallucination Rate across the three tasks studied in this work. Through manual analysis, we found evidence that during the reasoning process led by cautious system message, Orca 2 might extrapolate the information available in the context, and uses the extrapolated content to create the summary. The ungrounded generated contents are often factually accurate, but they are not supported by the context. Examples of this situation for each of the datasets are presented in Appendix F.

### Safety

A comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for safety is quite complex and is an open area of research. In this study, we have conducted experiments on the publicly available datasets described in

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline
**Model** & **Turn 1** & **Turn 2** & **Average** \\ \hline Orca-2-7B & 6.14 & 5.15 & 5.65 \\ w/ cautious sm & 5.96 & 3.99 & 4.97 \\ \hline Orca-2-13B & 6.69 & 5.60 & 6.15 \\ w/ cautious sm & 6.12 & 5.31 & 5.72 \\ \hline LLaMA-2-Chat-13B & 7.17 & 6.11 & 6.64 \\ WizardLM-13B & 7.14 & 5.58 & 6.36 \\ Orca-1-13B & 6.66 & 5.19 & 5.92 \\ \hline LLaMA-2-Chat-70B & 7.05 & 6.59 & 6.82 \\ WizardLM-70B & 8.07 & 7.45 & 7.76 \\ \hline ChatGPT & 8.19 & 7.84 & 8.01 \\ GPT-4 & 9.01 & 9.06 & 9.04 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: MT-Bench scores per turn and average section 5.2.6 and a recent measurement framework proposed in [34]. They represent tasks with a focus domain of implicit and explicit toxicity, truthfulness, three categories of content harms, three domains for IP and three areas of jailbreaks. Our experiments include two evaluation regimes for each model, a discriminative regime where the model is used as a classifier to identify the type of given content, and a generative regime where the model is prompted to produce output that does not follow safety guidelines and is then evaluated on how many times it follows the prompt intent. Please note that in both regimes, models might behave differently both in terms of not filtering the content correctly or filtering the content more aggressively which might result in erasure for different social groups.

For _discriminative evaluation_ we have used ToxiGen, HHH and TruthfulQA:

**ToxiGen:** In the human annotated portion of this dataset each of the statements has a toxicity score provided by three human annotators. For the purpose of this experiment, we formulate the task as a classification task and assign each statement with a score lower than 2.5 as benign and greater than or equals to 2.5 as being toxic. The model is then prompted to score each of the statements. The model's accuracy is calculated as the percentage of statements it classifies correctly as toxic or benign. Results are presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8.

From the experiments we observe that Orca-2-7B, WizardLM-13B, LLaMA-2-70B and Orca 1 models perform better at classifying toxic statements than classifying neutral statements. This is an important note as it might cause erasure (filtering out the content related to specific groups of people even if it is not problematic) for target identity groups in ToxiGen. Orca-2-13B, WizardLM-70B and LLaMA-2-13B do not have this problem for this experiment.

Note that we also conducted an experiment to ensure instruction following of various models for this experiment, i.e., making sure the model outputs the requested format. All models in Orca 2 family, LLaMa-2 family and WizardLM family had rates above 96%. They were relatively lower for Orca 1 model, 79%, which does not follow task instruction as well.

Performance breakdown for each of the categories in ToxiGen are presented in Appendix D.1.

**TruthfulQA:** For evaluation on this dataset we have used the multiple-choice variant of the dataset, TruthfulQA MC from EleutherAI, which includes questions from TruthfulQA in multiple choice format. Multiple choice style evaluation for TruthfulQA has also been used

Figure 6: The hallucination rate evaluated by GPT-4 as discriminator averaged over three abstractive summarization benchmarks described in section 5 (the lower the better). Task specific performance breakdown is reported in Table 11.

in [44]. There are related works that have used generative style evaluation for this dataset (e.g., [57]) using another model as judge which we have not used in this experiment.

The results are presented in Figure 9, where we observe that Orca-2-13B performs better in answering the questions compared to other models of similar size and comparable to models with much larger size.

Figure 8: ToxiGen evaluation results for neutral statement classification averaged over all the 13 categories.

Figure 7: ToxiGen evaluation results for toxic statement classification averaged over all the 13 categories.

Please note that the reason for the performance difference for both LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and LLaMA-2-Chat-70B from the ones reported in LLaMA-2 report [57] for TruthfulQA is that the evaluation schemes are different. In LLaMA-2, they report a generative style evaluation where GPT-3 has been used as annotator while we have used multiple choice version of the dataset to avoid limitations of using GPT-3 (or any LLM) as a judge (order bias, length bias, etc) when the gold labels are available.

**HHH:** The results for the HHH task are presented in Figure 10 where both Orca-2-13B and Orca-2-7B outperform models of similar sizes. We also observed that LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and LLaMA-2-Chat-70B models occasionally avoid answering HHH questions, responding with answers like: "I cannot fulfill your request." Additionally, both LLaMA-2-Chat and Orca 2 models (w/ cautious systems message) tend to produce open-ended responses to some questions (especially longer ones) instead of choosing a specific answer. We believe that additional prompt engineering could help address some of these cases.

For _generative style evaluation_ we have used the framework proposed in [34] and ToxiGen. It is important to note that _any_ model used as annotator (including the ones that we have selected) is a proxy and may come with its own weaknesses and biases depending on the data it has been trained on. We recommend to take these experiments as an evaluation methodology and repeat them for the given domain of interest or application using the models and annotation approaches for the given domain:

**Automated RAI Measurement Framework:** We employ a recently proposed framework for automated measurement of Responsible AI metrics for LLMs [34]. In this framework, one LLM poses as a user and engages in a synthetic conversation with the LLM under test which is Orca 2 in the experiments we are presenting in this section. Another LLM then evaluates the responses to measure its tendency to violate Responsible AI guidelines from the following aspects: (1) How many times the user succeeded in Jailbreaking the model under the test? (2) How many times the model under the test generates Potentially Harmful Content? (3) How many times the model leaks Intellectual Property (IP)? (For example while responding to "The Great Gatsby book full text"). These categories are divided into multiple sub-categories described in [34]. Results of our experiments using this framework are presented in Table 4 and 5. Please note that the automated framework sets its own

Figure 9: Performance of different models on TruthfulQA benchmark. We report the accuracy as the percentage of times the model generated the correct answer to the given multiple choice questions.

system message while assessing chat model's safety. Please note that Orca 2 has not gone through RLHF safety training similar to LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and the tables 4 and 5 reflect some aspects of that. We hypothesize that since the teacher models (ChatGPT, GPT-4) have gone through various steps of safety tuning, and the use of content filtering in the data generation process, Orca 2 might have learned some aspects of those through instruction tuning. We probe some of the categories where we see a larger difference (e.g., violent) and observe that Orca 2 tends to counter the harmful positions more often (which is penalized by the metric), while models that have gone through RLHF safety training tend to decline to respond more often (which is rewarded by the metric).

**ToxiGen:** In this experiment, we prompt the model with the test set of ToxiGen [16] dataset containing toxic and benign statements. The task for the model is to continue the text further. To compute the toxicity of the content generated, we use HateBERT [4], an off-the-shelf hate speech detector to generate toxicity probability with higher values signifying more toxicity in the content. We represent them as a number between 0 to 100 for better visibility. Results for generation using toxic and neutral prompts are presented in Figure 11

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c|c c c} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Potentially Harmful Content} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{IP} \\ \cline{2-7} Model & Sexual\(\downarrow\) & Violent\(\downarrow\) & Hate\(\downarrow\) & Songs\(\downarrow\) & Books\(\downarrow\) & News\(\downarrow\) \\ \hline Orca-2-13B & 0.60\% & 13.47\% & 2.26\% & 18.47\% & 21.85\% & 21.48\% \\ LLaMA-2-Chat-13B & 0.00\% & 0.17\% & 0.83\% & 16.84\% & 15.49\% & 18.18\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Effect of Task-Specific Data with Story Reordering

We create 5,000 training samples for story reordering using the prompt in Figure 3. We do not use the complex prompt during Orca 2 training (i.e. applying _prompt erasing_). We mix the task-specific data with the rest of the training dataset and evaluate Orca 2 on a distinct set of the ROCStories corpus [41]. While sampling the test instances, we remove any instances from ROCStories that are in FLAN training split to avoid contamination. Figure 12 compares the performance of Orca 2 with different system messages for GPT-4. It also captures the performance of ChatGPT, Orca 1, LLaMA and WizardLM models. This experiment highlights the potential of specializing Orca 2 models for specific tasks using synthetic data generated with _prompt erasing_.

GPT4 refers to default GPT-4 answer (Answer 1 in Figure 3), GPT4 w/ step-by-step corresponds to default step-by-step answer (Answer 3 in Figure 3), GPT4 w/ explain refers to answer then explain type of answer (Answer 2 in Figure 3). GPT4 w/ special step-by-step (Answer 4 in Figure 3) is used to generate data for Orca 2.

## 7 Limitations

Orca 2, built upon the LLaMA 2 model family, retains many of its limitations, as well as the common limitations of other large language models and limitations originating from Orca 2's training process, including:

**Data Biases:** Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry biases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could be potentially biased or unfair.

**Lack of Transparency:** Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act as "black boxes", making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or decisions. We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information11.

Footnote 11: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note)

**Content Harms:** There are various types of content harms that large language models can cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take actions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services provided by different companies and institutions. On an important note, we hope for better regulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms for AI technologies in future. We value and acknowledge the important role that research and open source community can play in this direction.

**Hallucination:** It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given language model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is not obvious how to prevent these models from fabricating content. Moreover, it is not clear whether small models may be more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation use cases due to their smaller sizes and hence reduced memorization capacities. This is an active research topic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding and mitigations around this topic.

**Potential for Misuse:** Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could be maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.

**Data Distribution:** Orca 2's performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution of the tuning data. This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in the training dataset such as math and coding.

**System messages:** Orca 2 demonstrates variance in performance depending on the system instructions. Additionally, the stochasticity introduced by the model size may lead to generation of non-deterministic responses to different system instructions.

**Zero-Shot Settings:** Orca 2 was trained on data that mostly simulate zero-shot settings. While the model demonstrates very strong performance in zero-shot setting, it does not show the same gains of using few-shot learning compared to other, specially larger, models.

**Synthetic data:** As Orca 2 is trained on synthetic data, it could inherit both the advantages and shortcomings of the models and methods used for data generation. We posit that Orca 2 benefits from the safety measures incorporated during training and safety guardrails (e.g., content filter) within the Azure OpenAI API. However, detailed studies are required for better quantification of such risks.

**Small Model Capacity:** We note that post-training, while significantly beneficial in teaching the model how to solve a task, it does not necessarily teach the model new knowledge. Hence post-trained models will be mostly limited by the knowledge learned during pre-training. While this process can enhance the small model ability to reason, it does not expand its ability as a knowledge store. As such Orca 2is perhaps more suitable as reasoning engine over knowledge provided to the model in its context window, or when fine-tuned to specialize into narrower domains.

This model is solely designed for research settings, and its testing has only been carried out in such environments. It should not be used in downstream applications, as additional analysis is needed to assess potential harm or bias in the proposed application.

Conclusions

Our study has demonstrated that improving the reasoning capabilities of smaller language models is not only possible, but also attainable through training on tailored synthetic data. Orca 2 models, by implementing a variety of reasoning techniques and recognizing the most effective solution strategy for each task, achieve performance levels comparable to, and often exceeding, models that are much larger, especially on zero-shot reasoning tasks. Though these models still exhibit limitations and constraints inherent to their base models, they show a promising potential for future improvement, especially in terms of better reasoning capabilities, control and safety, through the use of synthetic data for post-training. While Orca 2 models have not gone through RLHF training for safety, we believe that the use of synthetic data for post-training that has been filtered with various content safety filters could provide another opportunity for improving the overall safety of the models. While the journey towards fully realizing the potential of small language models is ongoing, our work represents a step forward, especially highlighting the value of teaching smaller models to reason. It also highlights the potential of using tailored and high-quality synthetic data, created by a more powerful model, for training language models using complex prompts and potentially multiple model calls. While frontier models will continue to demonstrate superior capabilities, we believe that research toward building more capable smaller models will help pave the way for new applications that require different deployment scenarios and trade offs between efficiency and capability.

Evaluation of Grounding in Abstractive Summarization

Fabrication and hallucination is an important challenge for modern LLMs with various aspects of complexity. Among them grounding is one of the most important ones where the goal is to respond to a query grounded in a given context in a generative manner. Abstractive summarization as a task has these characteristics and is one of the appropriate test beds to evaluate for grounding. In this section, we present zero shot evaluation for three abstractive summarization datasets that we have described in section 5: ACI-BENCH [59], QMSum [68], and MS MARCO [2]. The primary objective is to measure the quality of generated summaries and the hallucination rate of different models studied in this work. To measure the hallucination rates we follow the methods proposed in [59] and [21].

### Hallucination Rate Evaluation

Following the evaluation scheme described in section 6.5, Table 11 presents hallucination rate results for Orca 2 with empty system message and baseline models.

### Evaluation of Generated Summaries

Evaluating the quality of generated summaries with respect to gold summaries requires using both automatic metrics and human evaluation and depending on various evaluation aspects can be quite complex. In this work we have used the following automatic metrics to report the results: BLEU [49], ROUGE-L [29]); and Perplexity [20]. The table 12 presents the results for Orca 2 with direct and cautious system messages and other LLMs studied in our experiments.

For ACI-BENCH Orca 2 shows better performance than both variants of LLAMA 2\({}^{\text{chat}}\) and comparable performance with WizardLM-70B. In QMSum, Orca-2-13B and Orca-2-7B perform better than both LLAMA-2-Chat-70B and WizardLM-70B while answers generated with the cautious system message tend to deviate more from the human generated label. This might be result of the reasoning process in which the model tends to reach out to its own conclusions that are not necessarily wrong, but use different wording from the context. For MS-MARCO, Orca 2 model family have high performance results on n-gram based metrics, while models without system message achieve perplexity results comparable to larger models. Please note that the MS-MARCO training set is in distribution and has been included in the instruction tuning data. The GPT-4 low performance on n-gram based metrics for this dataset can be explained by the size of GPT-4 answers when compared to human labels. In few words, the labels provided by this dataset are mostly small sentences, while GPT-4 tends to generate much longer answers with vocabulary not included in the labels.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline Model & ACI-BENCH & MS MARCO & QMSum & Average \\ \hline Orca-2-13B & 9.66 & 11.50 & 11.74 & 10.97 \\ w /cautious sm & 10.14 & 27.90 & 48.94 & 29.00 \\ \hline Orca-2-7B & 27.45 & 15.40 & 16.20 & 19.68 \\ w /cautious sm & 21.26 & 35.80 & 55.18 & 37.41 \\ \hline Orca-1-13B & 42.65 & 10.40 & 15.16 & 22.74 \\ LLaMA-2-Chat-13B & 61.46 & 40.88 & 40.26 & 47.53 \\ WizardLM-13B & 30.10 & 32.73 & 23.12 & 28.65 \\ \hline LLaMA-2-Chat-70B & 67.96 & 35.72 & 32.46 & 45.38 \\ WizardLM-70B & 14.56 & 18.94 & 13.50 & 15.67 \\ \hline ChatGPT & 3.38 & 7.11 & 8.81 & 6.43 \\ GPT-4 & 1.46 & 3.90 & 3.05 & 2.80 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 11: The hallucination rate evaluated by GPT-4 as the judge with a lower rate indicating better performance. The upper segment of the table provides a comparative analysis of 13B and 7B versions of Orca 2. The lower segment presents baseline models. Among all versions of Orca 2 and models of comparable size, Orca-2-13B emerges as the most effective model.

Comparing different versions and system messages of Orca 2 on all datasets, the models using direct system messages tend to perform better than their counterparts using the cautious system message, potentially indicating that answers produced by these models are closer to the ones expected in human-generated summaries. This is consistent with hallucination metrics used in previous section, where our analysis shows that answers using the cautious system messages tend to rephrase and extrapolate the original text.

Table 12: Abstractive summarization evaluation using automatic metrics BLEU, Rouge-L (abbreviated as R-L) and Perplexity (abbreviated as PPL). For perplexity, the lower is better. Based on n-gram based metrics, Orca-2-13B yields better performance in ACI-BENCH and QMSUM when compared to other Orca 2 models. Among other LLMs used as baselines, Orca-1-13B performs better for MS-MARCO and QMSum, while GPT-4 achieves the best performance for ACI-BENCH. Based on perplexity metric, there is not a clear winner among different Orca 2 models, but among baselines ChatGPT yields the best results for ACI-BENCH, while LLaMA-2-Chat-13B achieves the smallest perplexity for the other datasets. This analysis might change if the model used to compute the perplexity is different.

Throughout July 1945, the Japanese mainland, from Tokyo on Honshu northward to the coast of Hokkaido, were bombed as if an invasion were about to take place. In fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling Stalin at Potsdam. In 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments in Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming damage of an atomic bomb. On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany's advances in development of the atomic bomb. Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created in June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb. After four years of research and development efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area at Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more than 15,000 tons of TNT. Thus, the atomic bomb was born. Truman, the new U.S. president, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way less costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland. Japan's unsatisfactory reply to the Allies' Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.

On August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a specially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu. The combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion's immediate neighbourhood, produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely, and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000 others. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people, injured a like number and ruined 1.8 square miles. How many people were killed by the two bombs dropped in Japan? (A) Between 105,000 and 120,000 people. (B) Between 35,000 and 40,000 people. (C) Between 70,000 and 80,000 people. (D) Between 140,000 and 150,000 people.

First, let's identify the key information from the passage:

1. Atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima: killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, injured more than 70,000 others.

2. Atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki: killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people, injured a like number.

Now, let's break down the question:

- How many people were killed by the two bombs dropped in Japan?

We can use the information provided to calculate the total number of people killed by the two bombs:

1. Hiroshima: 70,000 to 80,000 killed

2. Nagasaki: 35,000 to 40,000 killed

Now, let's look at each answer choice and decide if it should be kept or eliminated:

(A) Between 105,000 and 120,000 people: This answer choice includes both the number of people killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so it should be kept.

(B) Between 35,000 and 40,000 people: This answer choice only includes the number of people killed in Nagasaki, so it should be eliminated.

(C) Between 70,000 and 80,000 people: This answer choice only includes the number of people killed in Hiroshima, so it should be eliminated.

(D) Between 140,000 and 150,000 people: This answer choice is too high, as it exceeds the total number of people killed in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so it should be eliminated.

We are left with one possible answer:

Final Answer: (A) Between 105,000 and 120,000 people.

MMLU

To test whether extensive exercise lowers the resting heart rate, a study is performed by randomly selecting half of a group of volunteers to exercise 1 hour each morning, while the rest are instructed to perform no exercise. Is this study an experiment or an observational study? Options : (A) An experiment with a control group and blinding (B) An experiment with blocking (C) An observational study with comparison and randomization (D) None of the above

Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm

Step 1: Identify key concepts and information

- Test whether extensive exercise lowers resting heart rate

- Study performed by randomly selecting half of a group of volunteers

- Half exercise 1 hour each morning, the rest perform no exercise

Step 2: Break down the question

- Determine if the study is an experiment or an observational study

Step 3: Use relevant information

- Experiments involve manipulating variables and observing the effects

- Observational studies involve observing and recording variables without manipulation

Step 4: Evaluate answer choices

(A) An experiment with a control group and blinding

- Control group is present, but there is no blinding

(B) An experiment with blocking

- There is a control group, but blocking is not mentioned

(C) An observational study with comparison and randomization

- Comparison is present, but it's not an observational study since variables are manipulated

(D) None of the above

Step 5: Narrow down choices

- Eliminate (A) because there is no blinding

- Eliminate (B) because blocking is not mentioned

- Keep (C) because it has some elements of the study

- Keep (D) as a possibility

Step 6: Compare remaining choices

- (C) is not an observational study since variables are manipulated

- (D) is a possibility since none of the other options perfectly fit

Step 7: Choose the best answer

- The best answer is (D) None of the above because the study is neither an experiment nor an observational study. It is a quasi-experimental study, as it has a control group and random assignment but lacks blinding and manipulation of variables.

Final Answer: (D) None of the above

Summarize the conversation to generate a clinical note with four sections: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAM, RESULTS, ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. The conversation is: [doctor] hi, ms. thompson. i'm dr. moore. how are you? [patient] hi, dr. moore. [doctor] hi. [patient] i'm doing okay except for my knee. [doctor] all right, hey, dragon, ms. thompson is a 43 year old female here for right knee pain. so tell me what happened with your knee? [patient] well, i was, um, trying to change a light bulb, and i was up on a ladder and i kinda had a little bit of a stumble and kinda twisted my knee as i was trying to catch my fall. [doctor] okay. and did you injure yourself any place else? [patient] no, no. it just seems to be the knee. [doctor] all right. and when did this happen? [patient] it was yesterday. [doctor] all right. and, uh, where does it hurt mostly? [patient] it hurts like in, in, in the inside of my knee. [doctor] okay. [patient] right here. [doctor] all right. and anything make it better or worse? [patient] i have been putting ice on it, uh, and i've been taking ibuprofen, but it doesn't seem to help much. [doctor] okay. so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago, and you've hurt something inside of your right knee. [patient] mm-hmm. [doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice, uh, putting some ice on it, and hasn't really helped and some ibuprofen. is that right? [patient] that's right. yeah. [doctor] okay, let's review your past history for a second. it looks like, uh, do you have any other past medical history? [patient] uh, afib. [doctor] okay, and you taking any medications for that? [patient] yeah, i am. um, begins with a d. [doctor] uh, digoxin? [patient] that's it. yeah, that's it. [doctor] okay, all right. how about any surgeries in the past? [patient] i have had a nose job. [doctor] all right. um, let's do your exam, okay? so is it tender... where is it mostly tender right now? [patient] right on the inside of my knee. right here. [doctor] all right, so if i bend your knee forward, does that seem to hurt? [patient] yes, that hurts. [doctor] all right, how about if i twist it a little bit that way. [patient] that hurts a lot. [doctor] okay, okay. and how about down here? do you feel me touch you down here? [patient] yes. [doctor] all right. any other pain down here in your calves? [patient] no. [doctor] no, okay. so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area. uh, there is no, uh, there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your, uh, when i, uh, uh, do some valgus stressing on your, on your leg. um, you have normal sensation. so let's take a look at your x-rays. [patient] okay. **[doctor] okay. hey dragon, show me the x-rays. so looking at the x-ray, um, of your left knee, uh, it appears to be there's no fractures there right now. i don't see any, uh, there's a little bit of, uh, fluid, uh, but there is no, uh, there's no, um, fracture or there's no dislocation. everything else seems to be lined up properly, okay? [patient] okay. [doctor] so in summary after my exam, uh, looking at your knee, uh, on the x-ray and your exam, you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus, so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain. uh, at this point, my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace, uh, and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days. we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing, and if it's not better, we'll get an mri at that time. [patient] okay. [doctor] i'm going to recommend we give you some motrim, 800 milligrams. uh, you can take it about every six hours, uh, with food. uh, and we'll give you about a two week supply. [patient] okay. [doctor] okay. uh, do you have any questions? [patient] no, i think i'm good. [doctor] all right. hey, dragon, order the medications and procedures discussed, and finalize the report. okay, come with me and we'll get you checked out.

The team building meeting began with the project manager suggesting that everyone draw their favorite animal and share its characteristics. The participants drew their animals and shared their reasons for liking those animals. The discussion included topics such as the animals' appearance, behavior, and unique features. The team members also shared their personal experiences with the animals they chose. The meeting served as a fun and engaging way for the team to bond and get to know each other better.

Orca-2-13B w/ cautious sm

Key points:

- The team is doing a team building activity where they draw their favourite animals and share their characteristics

- The project manager is the last one to speak and draws a giraffe

- The team members have different opinions and preferences about animals and some of them are allergic to cats

- The team members also share some references and jokes about animals from books and movies

Summary:

The team building activity involves drawing and talking about animals. **The project manager goes first and draws a giraffe**, admitting that it looks more like a dinosaur. The other team members follow and draw animals like fish, kitty, badger, and **liver**. They explain why they like their animals and what makes them unique. They also mention some books and movies that feature animals, like Wind in the Willows and Brian, a Liverpoolian writer. The team has some fun and learns more about each other's tastes and humour.

To answer the query, we need to find the passages that mention procell batteries and summarize the information they provide. We can use the following steps:

- Scan the passages for the term procell batteries or its variations (such as duracell procell batteries or procell batteries).

- Identify the main idea or definition of procell batteries in each passage.

- Compare and contrast the different definitions to find the common or most relevant features of procell batteries.

- Write a concise and accurate answer based on the information from the passages.

Using these steps, we can answer the query as follows:

- The first passage is about duracell procell aa batteries and how to follow or unfollow them on eBay. It does not provide any definition or information about procell batteries, so we can skip it.
- The second passage is a product description of duracell procell batteries that states they are an easy choice for low-cost and high-performance batteries. They are made in the USA for AA, C, D, and 9V, and in Thailand for AAA. They are similar to Duracell Coppertop batteries, but with different packaging and advertising. This passage gives us some basic information about procell batteries, but it does not explain what they are or how they differ from other batteries.
- The third passage is a promotional message for a new Duracell Professional website that claims to be a resource for finding the right battery solution. It does not mention procell batteries specifically, so we can skip it.
- The fourth passage is a product description of LR6 Duracell ProCell alkaline batteries that are sold by Batteries Plus Bulbs. It says they are guaranteed fresh and have a wide selection of sizes available. It does not mention procell batteries or Duracell specifically, so we can skip it.
- The fifth passage is a product description of Duracell Procell batteries that says they are made to rigorous specifications for dependable and long-lasting performance. They are designed for industrial and professional use, and are not sold in blister packs. They are charged higher than Duracell Coppertop batteries. This passage gives us more information about procell batteries, but it does not explain what they are or how they are different from other batteries.
- The sixth passage is a follow-up message for procell batteries on eBay that works similarly to the first passage. It does not provide any definition or information about procell batteries, so we can skip it.
- The seventh passage is a comparison of Duracell Coppertop and Duracell Procell batteries that says they are both alkaline batteries, but Procell batteries are designed for industrial and professional use, while Coppertop batteries are designed for consumer use. Procell batteries are packaged differently and have higher voltage. This passage gives us a clear comparison of procell batteries and Coppertop batteries, but it does not explain what procell batteries are or how they work.
- The eighth passage is a request for a volume quotation for Duracell Procell AA alkaline batteries in a pack of 24. It says **they are reliable and long-lasting power sources with 2850mAh of capacity and a 7-year shelf life**. This passage gives us some more information about procell batteries, but it does not explain what they are or how they are different from other batteries.
- The ninth passage is a list of related products that include different types of batteries. It does not mention procell batteries specifically, so we can skip it.
- The tenth passage is a purchase requirement for Duracell Procell batteries that says they are not intended for personal or consumer use, but only for business to business use. It does not explain what procell batteries are or how they work, so we can skip it.

Based on the information from the passages, we can write a possible answer as follows:
