      '\n' +
      'Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called **Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG)** that enhances an LM\'s quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called _reflection_ tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.1\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'State-of-the-art LLMs continue to struggle with factual errors (Mallen et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023) despite their increased model and data scale (Ouyang et al., 2022). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods (Figure 1 left; Lewis et al. 2020; Guu et al. 2020) augment the input of LLMs with relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks (Ram et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2023a). However, these methods may hinder the versatility of LLMs or introduce unnecessary or off-topic passages that lead to low-quality generations (Shi et al., 2023) since they retrieve passages indiscriminately regardless of whether the factual grounding is helpful. Moreover, the output is not guaranteed to be consistent with retrieved relevant passages (Gao et al., 2023) since the models are not explicitly trained to leverage and follow facts from provided passages. This work introduces **Self-Reflective Retrieval-augmented Generation (Self-RAG)** to improve an LLM\'s generation quality, including its factual accuracy without hurting its versatility, via on-demand retrieval and self-reflection. We train an arbitrary LM in an end-to-end manner to learn to reflect on its own generation process given a task input by generating both task output and intermittent special tokens (i.e., _reflection tokens_). Reflection tokens are categorized into _retrieval_ and _critique_ tokens to indicate the need for retrieval and its generation quality respectively (Figure 1 right). In particular, given an input prompt and preceding generations, Self-RAG first determines if augmenting the continued generation with retrieved passages would be helpful. If so, it outputs a **retrieval** token that calls a retriever model on demand (Step 1). Subsequently, Self-RAG concurrently processes multiple retrieved passages, evaluating their relevance and then **generating** corresponding task outputs (Step 2). It then generates critique tokens to **criticize** its own output and choose best one (Step 3) in terms of factuality and overall quality. This process differs from conventional RAG (Figure 1 left), whichconsistently retrieves a fixed number of documents for generation regardless of the retrieval necessity (e.g., the bottom figure example does not require factual knowledge) and never second visits the generation quality. Moreover, Self-Rag provides citations for each segment with its self-assessment of whether the output is supported by the passage, leading to easier fact verification.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Self-Rag trains an arbitrary LM to generate text with reflection tokens by unifying them as the next token prediction from the expanded model vocabulary. We train our generator LM on a diverse collection of text interleaved with reflection tokens and retrieved passages. Reflection tokens, inspired by reward models used in reinforcement learning (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022), are inserted offline into the original corpus by a trained _critic_ model. This eliminates the need to host a critic model during training, reducing overhead. The critic model, in part, is supervised on a dataset of input, output, and corresponding reflection tokens collected by prompting a propriety LM (i.e., GPT-4; OpenAI 2023). While we draw inspiration from studies that use control tokens to start and guide text generation (Lu et al., 2022; Keskar et al., 2019), our trained LM uses critique tokens to assess its own predictions after each generated segment as an integral part of the generation output.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Self-Rag further enables a customizable decoding algorithm to satisfy hard or soft constraints, which are defined by reflection token predictions. In particular, our inference-time algorithm enables us to (1) flexibly adjust retrieval frequency for different downstream applications and (2) customize models\' behaviors to user preferences by leveraging reflection tokens through segment-level beam search using the weighted linear sum of the reflection token probabilities as segment score.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Empirical results on six tasks, including reasoning and long-form generation, demonstrate that Self-Rag significantly outperforms pre-trained and instruction-tuned LLMs that have more parameters and widely adopted RAG approaches with higher citation accuracy. In particular, Self-Rag outperforms retrieval-augmented ChatGPT on four tasks, Llama2-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) and Alpaca (Dubois et al., 2023) on all tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of training and inference with reflection tokens for overall performance improvements as well as test-time model customizations (e.g., balancing the trade-off between citation previsions and completeness).\n' +

      'Retrieval-Augmented GenerationRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments the input space of LMs with retrieved text passages (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020), leading to large improvements in knowledge-intensive tasks after fine-tuning or used with off-the-shelf LMs (Ram et al., 2023). A more recent work (Luo et al., 2023) instruction-tunes an LM with a fixed number\n' +

      '\n' +
      'of retrieved passages prepended to input, or pre-train a retriever and LM jointly, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on task datasets (Izacard et al., 2022b). While prior work often retrieves only once at the beginning, Jiang et al. (2023) propose to adaptively retrieve passages for generation on top of a proprietary LLM or Schick et al. (2023) train an LM to generate API calls for named entities. Yet, the improved task performance of such approaches often comes at the expense of runtime efficiency (Mallen et al., 2023), robustness to irrelevant context (Shi et al., 2023), and lack of attributions (Liu et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023). We introduce a method to train an arbitrary LM to learn to use retrieval _on-demand_ for diverse instruction-following queries and introduce controlled generation guided by reflections tokens to further improve generation quality and attributions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Concurrent RAG work.A few concurrent works2 on RAG propose new training or prompting strategies to improve widely-adopted RAG approaches. Lin et al. (2023) fine-tune both the retriever and LM on instruction-tuning datasets in two steps. While we also train our model on diverse instruction-following datasets, Self-Rag enables retrieval on demand and selection of the best possible model output via fine-grained self-reflection, making it widely applicable and more robust and controllable. Yoran et al. (2023) use a natural language inference model and Xu et al. (2023) use a summarization model to filter out or compress retrieved passages before using them to prompt the LM to generate the output. Self-Rag processes passages in parallel and filters out irrelevant ones through self-reflection, without relying on external models at inference. Moreover, our self-reflection mechanism also evaluates other aspects of the model output quality including factuality. LATS (Zhou et al., 2023) prompt off-the-shelf LMs to search for relevant information for question answering tasks and to generate with tree search, guided by LM-generated value scores. While their value function simply indicates an overall score of each generation, Self-Rag trains to an arbitrary LM to learn to generate fine-grained self-reflection and customizable inference.\n' +

      'Training and generating with critics.Training LLMs with reinforcement learning (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization or PPO; Schulman et al. 2017) from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning LLMs with human preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022). Wu et al. (2023) introduce fine-grained RLHF with multiple reward models. Though our work also studies fine-grained critique on retrieval and generation, we train our target LM on task examples augmented with reflection tokens from a critic model offline, with a far lower training cost compared to RLHF. In addition, reflection tokens in Self-Rag enable controllable generation at inference, while RLHF focuses on human preference alignment during training. Other works use general control tokens to guide LM generation (Lu et al., 2022; Korbak et al., 2023), while Self-Rag uses reflection tokens to decide the need for retrieval and to self-evaluate generation quality. Xie et al. (2023) propose a self-evaluation-guided decoding framework, but they focus only on reasoning tasks with one evaluation dimension (reasoning path consistency) and without retrieval. Recent work on LLM refinement (Dhuliawala et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Paul et al., 2023) prompts a model to generate task output, natural language feedback and refined task output iteratively, but at the cost of inference efficiency.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We introduce Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-Rag), shown in Figure 1. Self-Rag is a framework that enhances the quality and factuality of an LLM through retrieval and self-reflection, without sacrificing LLM\'s original creativity and versatility. Our end-to-end training lets an LM \\(\\mathcal{M}\\)**generate** text informed by **retrieved** passages, if needed, and **criticize** the output by learning to generate special tokens. These _reflection tokens_ (Table 1) signal the need for retrieval or confirm the output\'s relevance, support, or completeness. In contrast, common RAG approaches retrieve passages indiscriminately, without ensuring complete support from cited sources.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Problem Formalization and Overview\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Formally, given input \\(x\\), we train \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to sequentially generate textual outputs \\(y\\) consisting of multiple segments \\(y=[y_{1},\\ldots,y_{T}]\\), where \\(y_{t}\\) indicates a sequence of tokens for the \\(t\\)-th segment.3 Generated tokens in \\(y_{t}\\) include text from the original vocabulary as well as the reflection tokens (Table 1).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 3: In this paper, we treat one sentence as a segment in our experiments, but our framework is applicable to any segment unit (i.e., sub-sentence).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Inference overview.** Figure 1 and Algorithm 1 present an overview of Self-Rag at inference. For every \\(x\\) and preceding generation \\(y_{<t}\\), the model decodes a retrieval token to evaluate the utility of retrieval. If retrieval is not required, the model predicts the next output segment, as it does in a standard LM. If retrieval is needed, the model generates: a critique token to evaluate the retrieved passage\'s relevance, the next response segment, and a critique token to evaluate if the information in the response segment is supported by the passage. Finally, a new critique token evaluates the overall utility of the response.4 To generate each segment, Self-Rag processes multiple passages in parallel and uses its own generated reflection tokens to enforce soft constraints (Section 3.3) or hard control (Algorithm 1) over the generated task output. For instance, in Figure 1 (right), the retrieved passages \\(d_{1}\\) is selected at the first time step since \\(d_{2}\\) does not provide direct evidence (\\(\\boxed{\\texttt{IsNet}}\\) is Irrelevant) and \\(d_{3}\\) output is only partially supported while \\(d_{1}\\) are fully supported.\n' +

      '**Training overview.** Self-Rag enables an arbitrary LM to generate text with reflection tokens by unifying them as next token predictions from the expanded model vocabulary (i.e., the original vocabulary plus reflection tokens). Specifically, we train the generator model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) on a curated corpus with interleaving passages retrieved by a _retriever_\\(\\mathcal{R}\\) and reflection tokens predicted by a _critic_ model \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) (summarized in Appendix Algorithm 2). We train \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) to generate reflection tokens for evaluating retrieved passages and the quality of a given task output (Section 3.2.1). Using the critic model, we update the training corpus by inserting reflection tokens into task outputs offline. Subsequently, we train the final generator model (\\(\\mathcal{M}\\)) using the conventional LM objective (Section 3.2.2) to enable \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to generate reflection tokens by itself without relying on the critic at inference time.\n' +

For instruction-tuned LMs, we use the official system prompt or instruction format used during training if publicly available.

It also includes Llama2-FT, where Llama2 is fine-tuned on all training data we use without the reflection tokens or retrieved passages. We also report the result of retrieval-augmented baselines with LMs trained with private data: Ret-ChatGPT and Ret-Llama2-chat, which deploy the same augmentation technique above, as well as perplexity.ai, an InstructGPT-based production search system.

      '**Training data and settings.** Our training data consists of diverse instruction-following input-output pairs. In particular, we sample instances from Open-Instruct processed data (Wang et al., 2023) and knowledge-intensive datasets (Petroni et al., 2021; Stelmakh et al., 2022; Mihaylov et al., 2018). In total, we use 150k instruction-output pairs. We use Llama 7B and 13B (Touvron et al., 2023) as our generator base LM, and we use Llama2 7B as our base critic LM. For the retriever model \\(\\mathcal{R}\\), we use off-the-shelf Contriever-MS MARCO (Izacard et al., 2022) by default and retrieve up to ten documents for each input. More training details are in the Appendix Section B.1.\n' +

      '**Inference settings.** As a default configuration, we assign the weight terms \\(\\boxed{\\text{IsRel}}\\), \\(\\boxed{\\text{IsNet}}\\), \\(\\boxed{\\text{IsNet}}\\) values of 1.0, 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. To encourage frequent retrieval, we set the retrieval threshold to 0.2 for most tasks and to 0 for ALCE (Gao et al., 2023) due to citation requirements. We speed up inference using vllm (Kwon et al., 2023). At each segment level, we adopt a beam width of 2. For a token-level generation, we use greedy decoding. By default, we use the top five documents from Contriever-MS MARCO (Izacard et al., 2022); for biographies and open-domain QA, we use additional top five documents retrieved by a web search engine, following Luo et al. (2023); for ASQA, we use the author-provided top 5 documents by GTR-XXL (Ni et al., 2022) across all baselines for a fair comparison.\n' +

      'Comparison against baselines without retrieval.Table 2 (top) presents the baselines without retrieval. Our Self-Rag (bottom two rows) demonstrates a substantial performance advantage over supervised fine-tuned LLMs in all tasks and even outperforms ChatGPT in PubHealth, PopQA, biography generations, and ASQA (Rouge and MAUVE). Our approach also significantly outperforms a concurrent method that employs sophisticated prompt engineering; specifically, on the bio generation task, our 7B and 13B models outperform the concurrent CoVE (Dhuliawala et al., 2023), which iteratively prompts Llama2658 to refine output.\n' +

      'Comparison against baselines with retrieval.As shown in Tables 2 (bottom), our Self-Rag also outperforms existing RAG in many tasks, obtaining the best performance among non-proprietary LM-based models on all tasks. While our method outperforms other baselines, on PopQA or Bio, powerful instruction-tuned LMs with retrieval (e.g., LLama2-chat, Alpaca) show large gains from their non-retrieval baselines. However, we found that these baselines provide limited solutions for tasks where we cannot simply copy or extract sub-strings of retrieved passages. On PubHealth and ARC-Challenge, baselines with retrieval do not improve performance notably from their no-retrieval counterparts. We also observe that most baselines with retrieval struggle to improve citation accuracy. On ASQA, our model shows significantly higher citation precision and recall than all models except ChatGPT. Gao et al. (2023) found that ChatGPT consistently exhibits superior efficacy in this particular task, surpassing smaller LMs. Our Self-Rag bridges this performance gap, even outperforming ChatGPT in citation precision, which measures whether the model-generated claim is fully supported by cited evidence. We also found that on the metrics for factual precision, Self-Rag 7B occasionally outperforms our 13B due to the tendency of smaller Self-Rag to often generate\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Ablation studies.We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play key roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: _No Retriever_ trains an LM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved passages; _No Critic_ trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the top one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and we use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in SAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including _No retrieval_ disables retrieval during inference; _Hard constraints_ indicates the model performance that retrieves when \\(\\boxed{Retrieve}\\)=Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; _Retrieve top 1_ always retrieves and uses the top one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; _Remove_ \\(\\boxed{Isstr}\\) indicates the model performance that removes \\(\\boxed{Isstr}\\) score only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this ablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of training variations. Later in this section, we conduct an analysis of the effect of training data size. We conduct the ablation studies on three datasets, PopQA, PubHealth, and ASQA. On ASQA, we evaluate models on sampled 150 instances and exclude ablations involving adaptive or no retrieval processes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We show in Table 2(a) the ablation results. The top part of the table shows results for training ablations, and the bottom part is for inference ablations. We see that all components play important roles. We also observe a large performance gap between Self-Rag and No Retriever or Critic baselines across tasks, indicating that training an LM with those models largely contributes to the performance gain of Self-Rag. Using the top passages regardless of their relevance (Retrieve top 1) as in conventional RAG approaches causes a large drop in PopQA and ASQA, and removing \\(\\boxed{Isstr}\\) during the beam search results hurts performance on ASQA. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Self-Rag\'s capabilities of carefully selecting generations based fine-grained multiple criterion, instead of naively using all of the top passages from the retrieval model or solely depending on relevance scores.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Effects of inference-time customization.** One key benefit of our proposed framework is that it enables us to control how much each critique type affects the final generation sampling. We analyze the effects of different parameter weights on the top of our 7B model during inference time on ASQA, where multiple evaluation aspects are considered. Figure 2(b) shows the effects of changing the weighting term for \\(\\boxed{Isstr}\\), which criticizes how supported the output is by the text passage. As the figure shows, increasing the weight leads to positive effects on the models\' citation precision since this puts more emphasis on whether model generation is supported by the evidence.

      '\n' +
      'This work aims to improve the factuality of LLM outputs, the lack of which continues to cause numerous real-world problems (e.g., spread of misinformation and provision of incorrect and dangerous advice). While our method shows significant improvements in terms of performance, factuality, and citation accuracy, it can still generate outputs that are not fully supported by the citations. We hope that explicit self-reflection and fine-grained attribution may help users verify factual errors in the model outputs.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '* **Retrieval-on-demand** ([Retrieval]): Given an input and previous-step generation (if applicable), an LM determines whether the continuation requires factual grounding. No indicates retrieval is unnecessary as the sequence does not require factual grounding or may not be enhanced by knowledge retrieval, Yes indicates retrieval is necessary. We additionally have continue to use evidence, which indicates that a model can continue to use the evidence retrieved previously. For instance, a passage may contain rich factual information, and thus Self-Rag generates multiple segments based on the passage.\n' +
      '* **Relevant** ([IsIsIs] ): Retrieved knowledge may not be always relevant to the input. This aspect indicates whether the evidence provides useful information (Relevant) or not (Irrelevant).\n' +
      '* **Supported** ([IsIsIs] ): Attribution is the concept of whether the output is fully supported by certain evidence (Menick et al., 2022; Bohnet et al., 2022). This aspect judges how much information in the output is entailed by the evidence. We evaluate attributions in three scale, Fully supported, Partially supported, and No support / Contradictory, following Yue et al. (2023); Nakano et al. (2021).\n' +
      '* **Useful** ([IsIsIs] ): Following the definitions from Liu et al. (2023), we define the perceived utility as whether the response is a helpful and informative answer to the query, independently from whether it is in fact factual or not. This can be also viewed as plausibility in Menick et al. (2022). For usefulness, we use a five-scale evaluation (1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest).\n' +

      'Details of GPT-4-based data collections.We use the instruction and demonstration pairs to prompt GPT-4, listed in Section D. Following an official recommendation, we separate instructions and outputs with "#". We use the temperature 1 and set the maximum output token counts to be 200. We discard instances where GPT-4 does not follow the designated output formats or output sequences that do not match our expected category names. As a result, we collected 1,2594 for [Retrieval], 11,181 for [IsIsIs], 19,317 for relevance, 3,831 for utility.\n' +

      'Manual analysis of the GPT-4 predictions.The authors of this paper manually assess randomly sampled 20 instances for each aspect and check if GPT-4 predictions match their assessments given the same instruction, demonstrations, and test instances. We found our assessments show high agreement with GPT-4 predictions, especially for relevance (95%), retrieval necessity (95%), and the degree of support (90%). Agreement was slightly lower in usefulness (80%), mostly due to the disagreement between 1 and 2 or 4 and 5.\n' +

We set the maximum token length to be 2,048 for the 7B model, and 1,524 for the 13B model due to the memory constraint. We use Deepspeed stage 3 (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) to conduct multi-GPU distributed training, with training precision Bfloat16 enabled.

      'Retrieval setup details.By default, we use Contriever-MS MARCO to retrieve the top five documents from Wikipedia, and use official Wikipedia embeddings based on 2018 English Wikipedia. On PopQA, where question and answer pairs are created based on WikiData in 2022, we found that the 2018 Wikipedia sometimes lacks articles about some entities that have been more recently added to Wikipedia. Therefore, for PopQA, we used the December 2020 preprocessed Wikipedia corpus provided by Izacard et al. (2022b) and generated document embeddings.8 The issues of performance variance from different Wikipedia dumps have been reported by prior work (Asai et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022b). Yet, we observe limited effectiveness of such off-the-shelf retrieval models trained primarily on knowledge-intensive tasks for open-ended generation (e.g., instruction following). Recent or concurrent work studies instruction-tuning of retrieval systems (Asai et al., 2023b) or joint training of retrieval and LM components (Lin et al., 2023), while we leave exploring the effectiveness of such approaches for future work. For bio generation and open-domain QA tasks, we additionally retrieve five documents using Google Programmable Search9 and search documents from English Wikipedia. As this API only provides snippets, we retrieve Wikipedia introductory paragraphs for the corresponding entities.\n' +

      'Detailed experimental settings for individual datasets.For OpenQA datasets, we set the maximum new token number to 100 tokens. For closed-set tasks (PubMedHealth and ARC-C), we set the maximum new token length to 50 for all baselines. For Self-Rag inference on PubMed and ARC-C, instead of determining the output with the highest score 4 as in other tasks, we aggregate the scores for each option and select the answer option with the highest score. We found in zero-shot settings of fact checking, some LLMs can generate capitalized class labels (e.g., True) while our gold labels are lower-cased. Therefore, across different LLMs, for fact checking, we lowercase the predictions. In multiple choice tasks, we found some models generate answers in slightly different ways (e.g., (A) instead of A). We slightly modify instructions for each LLM to avoid such format violations, and further conduct string matching between each candidate and model predictions if format violations still remain. After that processing, in closed set tasks, model predictions match one of the gold classes in almost all cases. For ALCE, we found that Llama2-chat tend to generate significantly lower outputs than other models (e.g., on average, their output is nearly 100 token, while ChatGPT generates 40 tokens on average), resulting in inflated str-em scores. We limit the maximum generation length to 100 tokens for all baselines to avoid this issue, rather than the original 300 tokens in the ALCE paper. Consequently, all of the baseline output length is within 30-60 tokens. For FactScore, we set the maximum new token length to 500 for baselines and 200 for Self-Rag at each segment level.\n' +

      'Reliance on parametric- and non-parametric memories.We conduct analysis on how frequently model answers come from retrieved passages (non-parametric memories) or their own parametric memories. On two open-domain QA datasets, TriviaQA and PopQA, we conduct the following analysis: 1) sample query models successfully answer correctly, 2) for each query in this group, check whether the matched ground-truth answer is a sub-string of the retrieved passage or not. We evaluate Self-Rag 7B, Alpaca 7B, Alpaca 13B, and Llama2-Chat-13B. We found that Self-Rag significantly less frequently generates answers that are not included in the provided evidence; in particular, in Alpaca 30B, 20% of the correct predictions are not included in the provided passages, followed by Llama2-chat 13B (18%) and Alpaca (15%), while it is only 2% in Self-Rag. When retrieved passages are not relevant, Self-Rag generates [IsREL]=Irrelevant, indicating that the following answers may not be factually grounded, while those instruction-tuned models continue to generate plausible answers.\n' +

The first reference states that Emperor Constantine made Sunday a day of rest from labor, and further the second citation supports the fact that the official adoption of Sunday as a day of rest by Constantine in AD 321. In the second example, the model predicts Contradictory to the first output as the output says the person has served as the CEO since 2010, while the passage says he stepped down as CEO in 2015. Indicating those factual contradictions as reflection tokens enables to enforcement of hard control and also verification of model outputs easily.

Computer memory operates at a high speed, for example random-access memory (RAM), as a distinction from storage that provides slow-to-access information but offers higher capacities. If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to secondary storage; a very common way of doing this is through a memory management technique called “virtual memory”. An archic synonym for memory is store.

There are two main kinds of semiconductor memory, volatile and non-volatile. Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory (used as secondary memory) and ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory (used for storing firmware such as BIOS). Examples of volatile memory are primary storage, which is typically dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), and fast CPU cache memory, which is typically static random-access memory (SRAM) that is fast but energy-consuming, offering lower memory<p>[[**Isstr**]=RelevantPrimary memory can be **accessed quickly, but it is volatile, meaning that the data is lost if the power is turned off.[[**Isstr**]=Partially Support[**].[[**Isstr**]=**0[The manager realizes that there is an extensive list of tasks that need to be completed in order to make the event a success.[[**Retriee**]=Yes]<p>Delegation-Delegation is the assignment of any responsibility or authority to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It is one of the core concepts of management leadership. However, the person who delegated the work remains accountable for the outcome of the delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions, i.e. it is a shifting of decision-making authority from one organizational level to a lower one. Delegation, if properly done, is not fabrication.

The content within the book is written using a question and answer forum. It contains some 250 questions, which The Science Teacher states each are answered with a concise and well-formulated essay that is informative and readable. The Science Teacher review goes on to state that many of the answers given in the book are little gems of science writing. The Science Teacher summarizes by stating that each question is likely to be thought of by a student, and that the answers are informative, well constructed, and thorough. The book covers information about the planets, the Earth, the Universe, practical astronomy, history, and awkward questions such as astronomy in the Bible, UFOs, and aliens.
