      'Language models produce a distribution over the next token; can we use this to recover the prompt tokens? We consider the problem of language model inversion and show that next-token probabilities contain a surprising amount of information about the preceding text. Often we can recover the text in cases where it is hidden from the user, motivating a method for recovering unknown prompts given only the model\'s current distribution output. We consider a variety of model access scenarios, and show how even without predictions for every token in the vocabulary we can recover the probability vector through search. On Llama-2 (b), our inversion method reconstructs prompts with a BLEU of \\(59\\) and token-level F1 of \\(78\\) and recovers \\(27\\%\\) of prompts exactly.1\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Language models are autoregressive, outputting the probability of each next token in a sequence conditioned on the preceeding text. This distribution is used to generate future tokens in the sequence. Can this distribution also be used to reconstruct the prompt?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In most contexts, this question is pointless, since we have already conditioned on this information. However, increasingly language models are being offered "as a service" where the user may have access to the outputs, but not all of the true prompt. In this context, it may be of interest to users to know the prompt and, perhaps, for the service provider to protect it. This goal has been the focus of "jailbreaking" approaches that attempt to use the forward text generation of the model to reveal the prompt.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We formalize this problem of prompt reconstruction as _language model inversion_, recovering the input prompt conditioned on the language model\'s next-token probabilities. Interestingly, work in computer vision has shown that probability predictions of image classifiers retain a surprising amount of detail (Dosovitskiy & Brox, 2016), so it is plausible that this also holds for language models. We propose an architecture that predicts prompts by"unrolling" the distribution vector into a sequence that can be processed effectively by a pretrained encoder-decoder language model. This method shows for the first time that language model predictions are mostly invertible: in many cases, we are able to recover very similar inputs to the original, sometimes getting the input text back exactly.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We additionally explore the feasibility of prompt recovery across a spectrum of real-world access patterns: full next-token probability outputs, top-K probabilities, probabilities per token upon request, and discrete sampling. We find that even in the case where we are only able to observe text output from the model (no probabilities), we can recover enough of the probability distribution to reconstruct the prompt.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our results show that systems that offer text-only access to a language model reveal information about their prompts. With enough queries, we can extract next-token probabilities at a given position, which can be used to reconstruct the input. Unlike text-based jailbreaks, our dense distribution inversion is less inhibited by post-pretraining reinforcement learning techniques such as RLHF to align the model. We also show that our inversion techniques transfer between models of the same family, and are not affected by language model scaling.\n' +

      '**Inverting deep embeddings.** Several lines of work in computer vision have shown that inputs can be approximately reconstructed from the logits of an image classifier (Mahendran and Vedaldi, 2014; Dosovitskiy and Brox, 2016; Teterwak et al., 2021) or from a self-supervised representation vector (Bordes et al., 2021). Some recent work (Takahashi et al., 2023) has shown that outputs of computer vision models may reveal private information when shared in a federated learning setup. There is also work on inverting representations in NLP: Song and Raghunathan (2020); Li et al. (2023); Morris et al. (2023) investigate the privacy leakage of text embeddings from encoder models. Morris et al. (2023) succeeds in recovering full text sequences from their embeddings by conditioning the encoder of an encoder-decoder Transformer for inversion. Ours is the first work to inversion directly from the probability outputs of language models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Model inversion and membership inference.** Given an output of a model, _model inversion_ aims to construct an input that produces that output. This problem was investigated for simple regression classifiers in (Fredrikson et al., 2014, 2015) and extended to neural face-recognition classifiers in (Zhang et al., 2020). In some cases, model inversion can help recover training data. For example, in face-recognition classifiers each class corresponds to a single person, thus any image recovered by model inversion is visually similar to the training images for the same class label. (Zhang et al., 2022) used model inversion techniques to recover memorized training data from pretrained language models. A related problem is _membership inference_: given a data point, determine whether it was part of the model\'s training data or not (Shokri et al., 2017). Duan et al. (2023) demonstrated membership inference for in-context learning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Prompt inversion is a form of model inversion, but we work with significantly more complex language models, where dimensionality of inputs is much higher than in the classifiers studied in prior model-inversion work. Instead of recovering information about the training data, we aim to recover the specific prompt given to the model and filter out information related to the training data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Model stealing.** As language models become more and more valuable, they are hidden behind increasingly stringent safeguards. Research into\'model stealing\' aims to explore how models themselves can be replicated via API queries (Tramer et al., 2016). Stealing NLP models has been demonstrated in many domains: linear text-based classification (Lowd and Meek, 2005), language classification (Pal et al., 2019; Krishna et al., 2020), machine translation Wallace et al. (2021), and even text retreival (Dziedzic et al., 2023). Recent work Gudibande et al. (2023) suggests that this form of imitation may create models that replicate surface-level syntax but do not learn more complex attributes like knowledge or factuality. Different than these works, we do not focus on reconstructing model weights from third-party model outputs, but finding a hidden prompt from outputs of a third-party model.\n' +

      'Figure 1: Under the assumption that a language model is offered as a service with a hidden prefix prompt that produces next-word probabilities, the system is trained from samples to invert the language model, i.e. to recover the prompt given language model probabilities for the next token.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Language models give the probability of the next token conditioned on the tokens that came before it, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{v}=p(x_{T+1}\\mid x_{1},...,x_{T};\\theta)\\), where \\(\\mathbf{v}\\in\\Delta^{|\\mathcal{V}|-1}\\) gives the probability of each of \\(|\\mathcal{V}|\\) possible next tokens. Generally these models have relatively large vocabulary sizes; the vocabulary \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) may contain tens or hundreds of thousands of elements.\n' +

      '### Logits contain residual information\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We construct a simple experiment to demonstrate the amount of information LM logits may convey about the input. Given 100 text inputs from Wikipedia, we substitute a single word in the first sentence with a synonym2. Let \\(\\hat{x}_{s}\\) be the synonym of word \\(x_{s}\\). To measure the change in language model output between the original sequence (containing \\(x_{s}\\)) and the new sequence (containing \\(\\hat{x_{s}}\\)), we compute two quantities: the KL divergence between the probability output of \\(p\\) for the original and synonym-swapped sequences, and the bit-level Hamming Distance between the two distributions when represented at 16-bit precision.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 2: We perform synonym swaps using GPT-4. More information on this experiment is given in Appendix D\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We plot KL and bitwise Hamming Distance relative to the position of the synonym swap in Figure 2. If LMs did not contain residual information about previous words, we would expect bitwise distance to decay to zero as we move away from the position of the swap. However, we observe that bits remain: although the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is only used to predict the next token, it clearly contains residual information about the prompt tokens \\(x_{1},...,x_{T}\\). Since KL puts most of its weight on the highest-likelihood tokens, it can decay to zero, while much of the information remains in the low-probability tokens.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Prompt Reconstruction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We now consider the problem of inverting the process: given the probability vector, we attempt to produce the prompt that led to these next-token probabilities. Given some unseen model \\(f:\\mathcal{V}^{T}\\rightarrow\\Delta^{|\\mathcal{V}|-1}\\) which gives next-token probabilities, we would like to learn to invert this function from samples: pairs of text prefixes and their associated next-token probability vectors \\((x_{1:T}^{1},\\mathbf{v}^{1})\\ldots(x_{1:T}^{J},\\mathbf{v}^{J})\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Inverting from outputs?Besides inverting from the probability vector, natural procedure to consider is predicting the prompt directly from the output of the language model. For example, given the model output "Bogota", we may predict the input "What is the capital of Columbia?". We hypothesize that a single logit vector contains much more detailed information about the prompt then a single sequence sampled from the argmax of these vectors. However, we consider this scenario in our _Sample inverter_ baseline described in Section 6.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Prompt datasets.We construct Instructions-2M, a meta-dataset consisting of 2.33M instructions including user and system prompts for a wide variety of different problems. This includes prompts from Supernatural Instructions (Wang et al., 2022), Self Instruct (Wang et al., 2023), Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Dolly3, ShareGPT4, Unnatural Instructions (Honovich et al., 2023), ChatBot Arena5.

      '\n' +
      'Assumptions of our threat model.We motivate this problem by the prevalence of language models as a service. In these use cases we assume that an unknown prefix sequence, known as the _prompt_, is prepended to the user input. We consider varying levels of model access: full distributional access, partial distributional access (top-K or by request), text output with user-defined logit bias, and text output access only. We assume no access to the model weights or activations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 4 Method: Learning to Invert Probabilities\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our proposed approach is to learn a conditional language model that maps from next-token probabilities back to tokens: \\(p(x_{1:T}\\mid\\mathbf{v})\\). We parameterize this distribution using a pretrained Transformer language model and train on samples from the unconditional model. Following work from Dumoulin et al. (2018) on feature-level conditioning, we use the cross-attention in an encoder-decoder Transformer to condition on the next-token vector.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since our encoder model is pretrained on text (we utilize T5), we must reformat \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to be fed to a language encoder. The simplest method is to project \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) and feed it as an input hidden vector. However, given the large size of the vocabulary \\(|\\mathcal{V}|\\) and the fact that it has been passed through a softmax, this would cause a large reduction in rank and a loss of information8. We instead \'unroll\' the vector into a sequence of pseudo-embeddings \\(\\mathbf{c}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\), so that we can condition transformer outputs on the full probability vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\),\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Where \\(x^{*}\\) is the predicted inversion, \\(d\\) is the embedding dimension, and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is padded with zeros at the final position. In practice we use \\(|\\mathcal{V}|=32000\\) and \\(d=768\\) for all experiments which leads to a fixed-length input sequence of \\(42\\) words.\n' +

      '## 5 Extracting Logits via API\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The previous sections assume we have access to the full language model output probability vector. However, many language model platforms limit the information returned from API calls. For example, a well-known service\'s API only exposes either samples or the top-5 log probabilities, but does not expose all output probabilities for a given input.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We therefore propose a method for extracting next-token probabilities from APIs where the full probability distribution is not immediately available. We take advantage of the fact that even when API services do not return the full probabilities, they typically allow users to add a _logit bias_ to adjust the distribution. In addition to providing a logit bias per API call, they typically allow setting the temperature parameter to zero to provide argmax of the distribution.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The probability of each token can therefore be recovered by finding its difference with the most likely word. We compute this difference by finding the smallest logit bias to make that word most likely. Algorithm 1 shows the approach, which relies on binary search to find the logit bias for each word.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that binary search can be conducted independently for each word, enabling full parallelization and requiring only a single logit bias at a time. By running this procedure for each word in the vocabulary, we can then reconstruct the full distribution \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\text{softmax}(\\text{logits})\\).

      '\n' +
      'Models.We train models to invert the distribution of Llama-2 (7B) and Llama-2 Chat (7B) (Touvron et al., 2023). We choose this model because, as of the time of publication, it is the best-performing open-source LLM at the 7B parameter scale. We assume full access to the model output probabilities except for during the distribution extraction experiments in Section 7, in which we set temperature to \\(0\\) and provide a single logit bias argument.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We parameterize the inversion model using the method described in Section 4 and select T5-base (Raffel et al., 2020) as our encoder-decoder backbone, which has \\(222M\\) parameters. We set the maximum sequence length to \\(64\\) for all experiments. We train models for \\(100\\) epochs with Adam optimizer with a learning rate of \\(2e-4\\). We use a constant learning rate with linear warmup over the first \\(25,000\\) training steps. We train in bfloat16 precision.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Metrics.We consider several metrics for prompt reconstruction: F1 score at the token level, BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) as a measure of string overlap, and exact match. We also consider the cosine similarity between the text embeddings of the original and recovered text as a measure of semantic relatedness. For cosine similarity, we use embeddings from the model text-embeddings-ada-002 available through the OpenAI API (Neelakantan et al., 2022). For each metric, we report error bounds as standard error of the mean (SEM).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We randomly hold out \\(1\\%\\) of the training data for testing. We additionally evaluate on two datasets of human-written prompts: code prompts from Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), and prompts extracted from the helpfulness and harmlessness data collected in Bai et al. (2022). Both datasets are drawn from different, more narrow distributions than our all-encompassing training dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Baselines.As we are the first work to consider inverting text directly from language model probabilities, there are no prior baselines to compare to. We therefore develop several baselines:\n' +

      '* _Jailbreak strings._ Human-written sequences that attempt to persuade the language model to divulge information from earlier in the sequence. We aggregate jailbreak strings from a variety of sources, including writing some manually. We only show the top jailbreak string in the tables, and include more results in the appendix. We source \\(20\\) jailbreak strings and test them on all models. For pre-trained Llama models, jailbreak strings are simply appended to the prompt. For chat models, we input the hidden prompt as a system instruction, along with a basic system instruction that instructs the model not to divulge its hidden prompt. We then input the jailbreak string as a user prompt. When reporting results, we report the mean performance of all prompts as well as an oracle figure indicating the best-performing jailbreak string on the test dataset selected after evaluation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* _GPT-4 Few-shot._ We prompt GPT-4 with examples of the top-K tokens by probability from Llama-2 input predictions. These example input-output pairs are prepended to the top probabilities for the hidden input.\n' +
      '* _Sample inverter._ Instead of inverting from next-token probability, we consider whether we might predict prompts from samples of the text outputs from the LM. To train this model, we sample outputs from Llama-2 7b chat and train a T5-base encoder-decoder to predict the input prompt from a given language model output.\n' +

      'Table 1 shows the main results of the experiments on reversing prompts from the Instructions-2M test set on both a raw LLM and RLHF Chat variant. We find that our method is able to achieve high BLEU score with the true prompts and achieve reasonable high-exact match reproduction. This approach is significantly better than few-shot prompting approaches, even when using GPT-4. The other trained approach (Sample Inverter) has a reasonable BLEU but 0 exact recoveries. The failure of sample inversion indicates that we are able to extract more usable information about the prompt from the logit vector than from the argmax outputs alone.\n' +

      '**Out-of-domain.** Table 2 shows the results when using prompts that are significantly different than the training distribution both in length and in content. For these domains, the model is significantly better than few-shot and jailbreaking on the RLHF model. With the chat model, we also observe that the jailbreak strings are especially ineffective on the Anthropic HH dataset, which contains a large amount of toxic content; this indicates that the chat model is less likely to obey the user\'s request when toxic content is present in the prompt. For the raw model, the inversion approach is a bit worse than jailbreaking on BLEU.\n' +

      '**APL-Based Logits Extraction.** Here we examine our ability to recover the next-token probability distribution. We simulate an API with a \'logit bias\' argument and argmax outputs using a local LLAMA-2 model. We visualize results of our technique (blue) vs. a naive Monte Carlo sample baseline (red) in Figure 4 (left). Our deterministic algorithm extracts useful logits in fewer queries than the Monte Carlo baseline. This result follows our hypothesis (Section 3.1) that useful information is contained in the probabilities of very unlikely words, which almost never occur during random sampling.\n' +

      '**Transferability.** We next investigate whether inversions transfer to models of different size by evaluating our inversion models trained on the 7B version of LLama-2 on the 13B version and 70B version. Results are shown in Table 3. We observe that inversions transfer reasonably well, performing best on code generation, and significantly better between non-RLHFd models than between the chat models. We speculate that models may need to be further fine-tuned to adapt to different models.\n' +

      '**Inversion and Language Model Scale.** To understand how dependent inversion results are to language model size, we consider inverting different sizes of GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and show results in Table 9 (Left). Interestingly, the reconstructions perform very similarly (within 1 point of BLEU score) regardless of the size of the language model inverted. The fact that output probabilities contain similar amounts of information even after going through vastly different amounts of processing (dependent on the varying model size) differ from the findings of Dosovitskiy and Brox (2016) who note that more layers of computation make inversion more difficult in CNNs.\n' +

(One might assume that this information is represented in the probability distribution, but interestingly the raw probabilities do not favor either title.)

We also consider removing all but a random subset of \\(k\\) components from the input. Figure 4 highlights the difference in reconstruction performance across levels of component removal. It appears that the model focuses more on the more likely words. In particular, the smallest \\(k\\) probabilities are only slightly more useful than a random \\(k\\). Reconstruction is poor in general until almost the entire distribution is re-included.\n' +

      '## 8 Conclusion & Future Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We define the problem of inversion from language model outputs and analyze inversion approaches from an attack and defense perspective. We show that this attack vector can be used to elicit hidden prompts from LM systems, even when we do not have direct access to model output distributions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_What are the limits of inversion?_ Our experiments show that much information about the input can be recovered from language model probabilities, but do not estimate the upper bound. The scaling analysis in Appendix G.1 implies that larger backbone models recover more information, but we do not run any experiments with backbone models larger than hundred-million parameter scale.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_How can we keep our prompts safe?_ Our experiments show that when sampling is enabled, we can reconstruct model probability distributions given enough queries to the model. The only foolproof way to protect prompts while providing users access to generate text from a language model is to disable top-logits access (output only text) and set temperature to 0.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Smarter parameterizations for inversion._ Future work might consider exploiting the fact that inputting a single suffix into a LM outputs multiple next-token predictions, one at each position, not just at the end. Additional research may find that utilizing a parameterization that integrates token embeddings with probability values, so that the inversion model \'knows\' which value corresponds which word, could be useful.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 4: (Left) Model performance under our API-based logit recovery technique vs the Monte Carlo baseline. The dotted blue line is given by reconstructing the prompt from the true probability vector. (Right) Model performance across levels of probability vector redaction. We test eliminating all except the top-K probabilities, all except the bottom-K, and all except random K, while varying K from 1 to 32,000 (full input dimensionality).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Ethics\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our research on the inversion of language models underscores the ethical implications surrounding the deployment of such models as services, particularly when providers maintain prompts that are valuable or contain personal information. Users of language models may be affected as they rely on these services for various purposes, including content generation and information retrieval. Prompt secrecy can compromise users\' trust in the systems they interact with, raising concerns about the transparency and integrity of the services themselves.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Lack of access to the underlying prompts hinders efforts to scrutinize, evaluate, and regulate language models effectively, thereby impeding advancements in the responsible and ethical development of AI technologies. Our research advances the field towards wider access to prompts while highlighting important privacy concerns for language-models-as-a-service providers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 10 Reproducibility\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Code for reproducing all experiments is available at anonymous.4open.science/status/language-model-inversion. Our dataset of prompts will be provided upon paper publication. All experiments are fully reproducible and documented in the Github repository, including all model-training, logit sampling, and evaluation.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'and train it via language modeling on the true prompt \\(x\\mid p(x)=v\\). For training, we sample outputs from a checkpoint of our conditional LM (section 4) to use as hypotheses. We train the model on outputs from Llama-2 (7B) for \\(100\\) epochs using the same hyperparameters outlined in Section 6. This model is able to achieve a one-step BLEU score of \\(58.7\\) on Instructions-2M, essentially recovering the original model\'s BLEU performance of \\(59.2\\). However, we see no increase in BLEU score after applying multiple steps of correction; after 5 steps, our model achieves a BLEU score of \\(56.43\\).\n' +

Perhaps that iterative refinement also may be more difficult in the space of language model probability outputs than text embeddings, due to a lack of convexity; it is also plausible that a different architecture or set of hyperparameters may be needed to train a more powerful inverter using iterative refinement.\n' +

      '### Ablations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We perform a variety of ablations of our model-training in a reduced setting: \\(1M\\) training examples from the dataset with a maximum sequence length of \\(16\\), training for \\(40\\) epochs. Ablation results are shown in Table 9 (Left).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Parameterization.We consider one alternative model architecture, an encoder-decoder with projection as in Morris et al. (2023). This model performs quite poorly, indicating that projecting the probability vector down to a smaller rank discards significant information. We also test an identical parameterization that conditions on the raw outputs of the language model instead of log-normalized probabilities to determine if un-normalized outputs contain more usable information than the probabilities. This removal also makes a difference: without applying the softmax to the inputs, we observe over a \\(20\\%\\) drop in BLEU.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since the main experiments are conducted in 16-bit precision, we test training in full precision (32-bit) to see if the additional bits improve performance. Training on full precision inputs gains about 1 BLEU point, indicating that we are not discarding significant information by storing probability vectors at half precision.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Scaling inverter.We train inverter models of varying size to see the effect of model scale on inversion performance. We note that the number of parameters in the inverter has a very large impact; with larger inverter models performing significantly better: under ablation settings, with the same number of training steps, the T5-large inverter achieves \\(24\\%\\) higher BLEU score than T5-small. This finding indicates that we may more accurately invert language models simply by scaling our system.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Reducing input dimensionality.When stored on disk in 32-bit precision, 10 million probability vectors for a vocabulary of size of \\(32,000\\) take up 1.28 TB. Is it necessary to retain the full dimensionality of these input vectors? Surprisingly, Table 9 (Right) indicates that the majority of the probability vector is required to achieve good inversion performance. Even though the top 1000 predicted tokens contain \\(98\\%\\) of the probability mass on average, training and evaluating with only the top \\(1000\\) tokens reduces performance by \\(45\\%\\).\n' +
