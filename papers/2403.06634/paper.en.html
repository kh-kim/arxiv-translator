      '\n' +
      'We introduce the first model-stealing attack that extracts precise, nontrivial information from black-box production language models like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT or Google\'s PaLM-2. Specifically, our attack recovers the _embedding projection layer_ (up to symmetries) of a transformer model, given typical API access. For under $20 USD, our attack extracts the entire projection matrix of OpenAI\'s ada and babbage language models. We thereby confirm, for the first time, that these black-box models have a hidden dimension of 1024 and 2048, respectively. We also recover the exact hidden dimension size of the gpt-3.5-turbo model, and estimate it would cost under $2,000 in queries to recover the entire projection matrix. We conclude with potential defenses and mitigations, and discuss the implications of possible future work that could extend our attack.\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Little is publicly known about the inner workings of today\'s most popular large language models, such as GPT-4, Claude 2, or Gemini. The GPT-4 technical report states it "contains no [...] details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar" (OpenAI et al., 2023). Similarly, the PaLM-2 paper states that "details of [the] model size and architecture are withheld from external publication" (Anil et al., 2023). This secrecy is often ascribed to "the competitive landscape" (because these models are expensive to train) and the "safety implications of large-scale models" (OpenAI et al., 2023) (because it is easier to attack models when more information is available). Nevertheless, while these models\' weights and internal details are not publicly accessible, the models themselves are exposed via APIs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper we ask: _how much information can an adversary learn about a production language model by making queries to its API?_ This is the question studied by the field of _model stealing_(Tramer et al., 2016): the ability of an adversary to extract model weights by making queries its API.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Contributions.We introduce an attack that can be applied to black-box language models, and allows us to recover the complete _embedding projection layer_ of a transformer language model. Our attack departs from prior approaches that reconstruct a model in a _bottom-up_ fashion, starting from the input layer. Instead, our attack operates _top-down_ and directly extracts the model\'s last layer. Specifically, we exploit the fact that the final layer of a language model projects from the hidden dimension to a (higher dimensional) logit vector. This final layer is thus low-rank, and by making targeted queries to a model\'s API, we can extract its embedding dimension or its final weight matrix.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Stealing this layer is useful for several reasons. First, it reveals the _width_ of the transformer model, which is often correlated with its total parameter count. Second, it slightly reduces the degree to which the model is a complete "black-box", which so might be useful for future attacks. Third, while our attack recovers only a (relatively small) part of the entire model, the fact that it is at all possible to steal _any_ parameters of a production model is surprising, and raises concerns that extensions of this attack might be able to recover more information. Finally, recovering the model\'s last layer (and thus hidden dimension) may reveal more global information about the model, such as relative size differences between different models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our attack is effective and efficient, and is applicable to production models whose APIs expose full logprobs, or a "logit bias". This included Google\'s PaLM-2 and OpenAI\'s GPT-4 (Anil et al., 2023; OpenAI et al., 2023); after responsible disclosure, both APIs have implemented defenses to prevent our attack or make it more expensive. We extract the embedding layer of several OpenAI models with a mean squared error of \\(10^{-4}\\) (up to unavoidable symmetries). We apply a limited form of our attack to gpt-3.5 at a cost of under $200 USD and, instead of recovering the full embedding layer, recover just the size of the embedding dimension.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Responsible disclosure.We shared our attack with all services we are aware of that are vulnerable to this attack. We also shared our attack with several other popular services, even if they were not vulnerable to our specific attack, because variants of our attack may be possible in other settings. We received approval from OpenAI prior to extracting the parameters of the last layers of their models, worked with OpenAI to confirm our approach\'s efficacy, and then deleted all data associated with the attack. In response to our attack, OpenAI and Google have both modified their APIs to introduce mitigations and defenses (like those that we suggest in Section 8) to make it more difficult for adversaries to perform this attack.\n' +

      '## 2 Related Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Model stealing attacks (Tramer et al., 2016) aim to recover the functionality of a black-box model, and optimize for one of two objectives (Jagielski et al., 2020):\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. _Accuracy_: the stolen model \\(\\hat{f}\\) should match the performance of the target model \\(f\\) on some particular data domain. For example, if the target is an image classifier, we might want the stolen model to match the target\'s overall accuracy on ImageNet.\n' +
      '2. _Fidelity_: the stolen model \\(\\hat{f}\\) should be functionally equivalent to the target model \\(f\\) on all inputs. That is, for any valid input \\(p\\), we want \\(\\hat{f}(p)\\approx f(p)\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper, we focus on high-fidelity attacks. Most prior high-fidelity attacks exploit specific properties of deep neural networks with ReLU activations. Milli et al. (2019) first showed that if an attacker can compute _gradients_ of a target two-layer ReLU model, then they can steal a nearly bit-for-bit equivalent model. Jagielski et al. (2020) observed that if the attacker only has query access to model outputs, they can approximate gradients with finite differences. Subsequent work extended these attacks to efficiently extract deeper ReLU models (Carlini et al., 2020; Rolnick and Kording, 2020; Shamir et al., 2023). Unfortunately, none of these approaches scale to production language models, because they (1) accept tokens as inputs (and so performing finite differences is intractable); (2) use activations other than ReLUs; (3) contain architectural components such as attention, layer normalization, residual connections, etc. that current attacks cannot handle; (4) are orders-of-magnitude larger than prior extracted models; and (5) expose only limited-precision outputs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Other attacks aim to recover more limited information. Wei et al. (2020) show that an adversary co-located on the same server as the LLM can recover the sizes of all hidden layers. Others have attempted to recover model sizes by correlating performance on published benchmarks with model sizes in academic papers (Gao, 2021).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Problem Formulation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We study models that take a sequence of tokens drawn from a vocabulary \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) as input. Let \\(\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\mathcal{X}\\right)\\) denote the space of probability distributions over \\(\\mathcal{X}\\). We study parameterized models \\(f_{\\theta}:\\mathcal{X}^{N}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\mathcal{X}\\right)\\) that produce a probability distribution over the next output token, given an input sequence of \\(N\\) tokens. The model has the following structure:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[f_{\\theta}(p)=\\mathsf{softmax}\\big{(}\\mathbf{W}\\cdot g_{\\theta}(p)\\big{)}, \\tag{1}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(g_{\\theta}:\\mathcal{X}^{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{R}^{h}\\) is another parameterized model that computes hidden states, \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) is an \\(l\\times h\\) dimensional matrix (the _embedding projection matrix_), and \\(\\mathsf{softmax}:\\mathbf{R}^{l}\\rightarrow[0,1]^{l}\\) is the softmax function applied to the resulting _logits_:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\mathsf{softmax}(\\mathbf{z})=\\left[\\frac{e^{\\mathbf{z}_{1}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{l} e^{\\mathbf{z}_{i}}},\\dots,\\frac{e^{\\mathbf{z}_{l}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{l}e^{\\mathbf{z}_{i}}} \\right]\\enspace.\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that the hidden dimension size is much smaller than the size of the token dictionary, i.e., \\(h\\ll l\\). For example, LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) chooses \\(h\\in\\{4096,5120,6656,8192\\}\\) and \\(l=32{,}000\\), and there is a recent trend towards increasingly large token sizes; GPT-4, for example, has a \\(\\approx\\)100,000 token vocabulary.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Threat model.** Throughout the paper, we assume that the adversary does not have any additional knowledge about the model parameters. We assume access to a model \\(f_{\\theta}\\), hosted by a service provider and made available to users through a query interface (API) \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). We assume that \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) is a perfect oracle: given an input sequence \\(p\\), it produces \\(y=\\mathcal{O}\\left(p\\right)\\) without leaking any other information about \\(f_{\\theta}\\) than what can be inferred from \\((p,y)\\). For example, the adversary cannot infer anything about \\(f_{\\theta}\\) via timing side-channels or other details of the implementation of the query interface.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Different open-source and proprietary LLMs offer APIs with varying capabilities, which impact the ability to perform model extraction attacks and the choice of attack algorithm. A summary of the different APIs we study, and our motivation for doing so, is presented in Table 1. The logits API is a strawman threat model where the API provides logits for all tokens in the response to a given prompt. We begin with this toy setting, as the attack techniques we develop here can be reused in subsequent sections, where we will first reconstruct the logits from more limited information (e.g., log-probabilities for only the top few tokens) and then run the attack.\n' +

      '**Algorithm 1** Hidden-Dimension Extraction Attack\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Intuition.** Suppose we query a language model on a large number of different random prefixes. Even though each output logit vector is an \\(l\\)-dimensional vector, they all actually lie in a \\(h\\)-dimensional subspace because the embedding projection layer up-projects from \\(h\\)-dimensions. Therefore, by querying the model "enough" (more than \\(h\\) times) we will eventually observe new queries are linearly dependent of past queries. We can then compute the dimensionality of this subspace (e.g., with SVD) and report this as the hidden dimensionality of the model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Formalization.** The attack is based on the following straightforward mathematical result:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Lemma 4.1**.: _Let \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(p_{1},\\ldots p_{n}\\right)\\in\\mathbf{R}^{l\\times n}\\) denote the matrix with columns \\(\\mathcal{O}\\left(p_{1}\\right),\\ldots,\\mathcal{O}\\left(p_{n}\\right)\\) of query responses from the logit-vector API. Then_\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[h\\geq\\text{rank}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(p_{1},\\ldots p_{n}\\right)\\right).\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Further, if the matrix with columns \\(g_{\\theta}\\left(p_{i}\\right)\\) (\\(i=1,...,n\\)) has rank \\(h\\) and \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) has rank \\(h\\), then_\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[h=\\text{rank}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(p_{1},\\ldots p_{n}\\right)\\right).\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Proof.: We have \\(\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{W}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is a \\(h\\times n\\) matrix whose columns are \\(g_{\\theta}(p_{i})\\) (\\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\)). Thus, \\(h\\geq\\text{rank}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\right)\\). Further, if \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) has rank \\(h\\) (with the second assumption), then \\(h=\\text{rank}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\right)\\). \n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Assumptions.** In Lemma 4.1, we assume that both the matrix with columns \\(g_{\\theta}\\left(p_{i}\\right)\\) and the matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) have rank \\(h\\). These matrices have either \\(h\\) rows or \\(h\\) columns, so both have rank at most \\(h\\). Moreover, it is very unlikely that they have rank \\(<h\\): this would require the distribution of \\(g_{\\theta}\\left(p\\right)\\) to be fully supported on a subspace of dimension \\(<h\\) across all \\(p_{i}\\) we query, or all \\(h\\ll l\\) columns of \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) to lie in the same \\((h-1)\\) dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbf{R}^{l}\\) (the output space of logits). In practice we find this assumption holds for all larger models (Table 2) and when different normalization layers are used (Appendix B.1).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Practical considerations.** Since the matrix \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is not computed over the reals, but over floating-point numbers (possibly with precision as low as 16-bits or 8-bits for production neural networks), we cannot naively take the rank to be the number of linearly independent rows. Instead, we use a practical _numerical rank_ of \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), where we order the singular values \\(\\lambda_{1}\\geq\\lambda_{2}\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\lambda_{n}\\), and identify the largest _multiplicative_ gap \\(\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{i+1}\\) between consecutive singular values. A large multiplicative gap arises when we switch from large "actual" singular values to small singular values that arise from numerical imprecision. Figure 2 shows these gaps. Algorithm 1 describes this attack.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Experiments.** In order to visualize the intuition behind this attack, Figure 1 illustrates an attack against the Pythia-1.4b LLM. Here, we plot the magnitude of the singular values of \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) as we send an increasing number \\(n\\) of queries to the model. When we send fewer than 2048 queries it\n' +

This is because \\(n<h\\), and so the \\(n\\times l\\) dimensional matrix \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) has full rank and \\(n\\) nontrivial singular values. But once we make more than \\(2048\\) queries to the model, and thus \\(n>h\\), the number of numerically significant singular values does not increase further; it is capped at exactly \\(2048\\).\n' +

In particular, the OpenAI API supports modifying logits for at most \\(300\\) tokens, and the logit bias for each token is restricted to the range \\([-100,100]\\)(OpenAI, 2023).\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Practical attacks must be _efficient_, both to keep the cost of extraction manageable and to bypass any rate limiters or other filters in the APIs. We thus begin with two cost definitions that we use to measure the efficacy of our attack.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We develop a technique to compute the logit vector for any prefix \\(p\\) via a sequence of queries with varying logit biases.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To begin, **suppose that the API returned the top \\(K\\) logits**. Then we could recover the complete logit vector for an arbitrary prompt \\(p\\) by cycling through different choices for the logit bias and measuring the top-\\(k\\) logits each time. In particular, for an API with top-5 logits we can send a sequence of queries\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\mathcal{O}(p,b_{k}\\!=\\!b_{k+1}\\!=\\!\\ldots\\!=\\!b_{k+4}\\!=\\!B)\\text{, for }k\\in\\! \\{\\!0,\\!5,\\!10,\\ldots\\!,|\\mathcal{X}|\\!\\}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'with a large enough \\(B\\). Each query thus promotes five different tokens \\(\\{k,k+1,\\ldots,k+4\\}\\) into the top-5, which allows us to observe their logits. By subtracting the bias \\(B\\) and merging answers from all of these queries, we recover the entire logit vector.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Unfortunately, we cannot use this attack directly because all production APIs we are aware of return _logprobs_ (the log of the softmax output of the model) instead of logits. The problem now is that when we apply a logit bias \\(B\\) to the \\(i\\)-th token and observe that token\'s logprob, we get the value\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[y_{i}^{B}=z_{i}+B-\\log\\big{(}\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\exp(z_{j})+\\exp(z_{i}+B)\\big{)}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We thus get an additional bias-dependent term which we need to deal with. We propose two approaches.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our first approach relies on a common "reference" token that lets us learn the relative difference between all logits (this is the best we can hope for, since the softmax is invariant under additive shifts to the logits). Suppose the top token for a prompt is \\(R\\), and we want to learn the relative difference between the logits of tokens \\(i\\) and \\(R\\). We add a large bias \\(B\\) to token \\(i\\) to push it to the top-5, and then observe the logprobs of both token \\(i\\) and \\(R\\). We have:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[y_{R}^{B}-y_{i}^{B}-B=z_{R}+z_{i}\\,.\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since we can observe 5 logprobs, we can compare the reference token \\(R\\) to four tokens per query, by adding a large bias that pushes all four tokens into the top 5 (along with the reference token). We thus issue a sequence of queries\n' +

      '\\[\\mathcal{O}(p,b_{i}=b_{i+1}=b_{i+2}=b_{i+3}=B)\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'for \\(i\\in\\{0,4,8,\\cdots,|\\mathcal{X}|\\}\\). This recovers the logits up to the free parameter \\(z_{R}\\) that we set to \\(0\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Query cost.** This attack reveals the value of 4 logits with each query to the model (the fifth being used as a reference point), for a cost of \\(1/4\\) queries per logit.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In Appendix E we present a second, more sophisticated method that allows us to recover 5 logits per query, i.e., a cost of \\(1/5\\), by viewing each logprob we receive as a linear constraint on the original logits.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Token cost.** Recall that our attack requires that we learn the logits for several distinct prompts; and so each prompt must be at least one token long. Therefore, this attack costs at least two tokens per query (one input and one output), or a cost of \\(1/2\\) for each token of output. But, in practice, many models (like gpt-3.5-turbo) include a few tokens of overhead along with every single query. This increases the token cost per logit to \\(\\frac{2+\\Delta}{4}\\) where \\(\\Delta\\) is the number of overhead tokens; for gpt-3.5-turbo we report \\(\\Delta=7\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'An improved cost-optimal attack.It is possible to generalize the above attack to improve _both_ the query cost and token cost. Instead of issuing queries to the model that reveal 4 or 5 logit values for a single generated token, we might instead hope to be able to send a multi-token query \\(\\begin{bmatrix}p_{0}&p_{1}&p_{2}\\dots p_{n}\\end{bmatrix}\\) and then ask for the logprob vector for each prefix of the prompt \\(\\begin{bmatrix}p_{0}\\end{bmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{bmatrix}p_{0}&p_{1}\\end{bmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{bmatrix}p_{0}&p_{1}&p_{2}\\end{bmatrix}\\) etc. OpenAI\'s API did allow for queries of this form in the past, by providing logprobs for _prompt_ tokens as well as generated tokens by combining the logprob and echo parameters; this option has since been removed.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Now, it is only possible to view logprobs of _generated_ tokens. And since only the very last token is generated, we can only view four logprobs for this single longer query. This, however, presents a potential approach to reduce the query and token cost: if there were some way to cause the model to emit a specific sequence of tokens \\(\\begin{bmatrix}p_{n+1}&p_{n+2}&\\dots&p_{n+m}\\end{bmatrix}\\), then we could inspect the logprob vector of each generated token.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We achieve this as follows: we fix a token \\(x\\) and four other tokens, and force the model to emit \\(\\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\\dots&x\\end{bmatrix}\\). Instead of supplying a logit bias of \\(B\\) for each of the five tokens, we supply a logit bias of \\(B\\) for token \\(x\\), and \\(B^{\\prime}<B\\) for the other four tokens. If \\(B^{\\prime}\\) is large enough so that the other tokens will be brought into the top-5 outputs, we will still be able to learn the logits for those tokens. As long as \\(B^{\\prime}\\) is small enough so that the model will always complete the initial prompt \\(p_{0}\\) with token \\(x\\) (and not any other), then we will be able to collect the logits on several prompts of the form \\(\\begin{bmatrix}p_{0}&x&x&\\dots&x\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Analysis.** It is easy to see that the query cost of this attack is \\(\\frac{1}{4m}\\), where \\(m\\) is the expansion factor. Further, since each query requires \\(1+m\\) tokens, the token cost is \\(\\frac{1+m}{4m}\\). (Or, \\(1+m+\\Delta\\) if the API has an overhead of \\(\\Delta\\) tokens.) Note that if \\(m=1\\), i.e., there is no expansion, this attack reduces to our first attack and the analysis similarly gives a query cost of \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{4}}\\) and a token cost of \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\).\n' +

      '### Extraction Attack for top-1 Binary Logit Bias APIs\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In light of our attacks, it is conceivable that model providers introduce restrictions on the above API. We now demonstrate that an attack is possible even if the API only returns the top logprob (\\(K=1\\) in the API from Section 5.1), and the logit bias is constrained to only take one of two values.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**API.** We place two following further restrictions on the logit bias API (Section 5.1): first, we set \\(K=1\\), and only see the most likely token\'s logprob; and second, each logit bias entry \\(b\\) is constrained to be in \\(\\{-1,0\\}\\). These constraints would completely prevent the attacks from the prior section. We believe this constraint is significantly tighter than any practical implementation would define.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Method.** At first it may seem impossible to be able to learn any information about a token \\(t\\) if it is not already the most likely token. However, note that if we query the model twice, once without any logit bias, and once with a logit bias of \\(-1\\) for token \\(t\\), then the top token will be _slightly_ more likely with a bias of \\(-1\\), with exactly how slight depending on the _value_ of token \\(t\\)\'s logprob. Specifically, in Appendix D we show the logprob equals \\((\\nicefrac{{1}}{{e}}-1)^{-1}(\\exp(y_{\\text{top}}-y^{\\prime}_{\\text{top}})-1)\\) where \\(y_{\\text{top}}\\) and \\(y^{\\prime}_{\\text{top}}\\) are the logprobs of the most likely token when querying with logit bias of \\(0\\) and \\(-1\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Analysis.** This attack requires \\(1\\) query and token per logprob extracted. However, as we will show in the evaluation, this attack is much less numerically stable than the previously-discussed attacks, and so may require more queries to reach the same level of accuracy.\n' +

To exploit situations such at this, we further develop several logprob-free attacks that recover the complete logit vector by performing binary search on the logit bias vector, albeit at increased cost.\n' +

In Table 3 we report the average number of bits of agreement between the true logit vector and the recovered logit vector, as well as the (amortized) number of queries required to recover one full logit vector.\n' +

      'Generally, attacks that operate under stronger threat models have higher precision. But theoretical improvements are not always practical: the theoretically stronger attack from SSE that learns 5 logprobs per query in practice requires more queries and recovers logits with lower fidelity. This is because this attack is numerically unstable: it requires a potentially ill-conditioned matrix, and therefore can require re-querying the API after adjusting the logit bias. Our strongest logprob-free attack is highly efficient, and recovers \\(18\\) bits of precision at just \\(3.7\\) queries per logit. In Appendix F we theoretically analyze how far this is from optimal, and find it is within a factor of two.\n' +

      '### Stealing Parts of Production Models\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We now investigate our ability to steal production language models, focusing on five of OpenAI\'s models available on 1 January 2024: ada, babbage, babbage-002, gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, and gpt-3.5-turbo-1106. We selected these models because these were the only production models which were able to receive advance permission to attempt an extraction attack; we are exceptionally grateful to OpenAI for allowing us to perform this research using their models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Given the results from the prior section, we chose to implement the improved 4-logprob attack (Section 5.3) because it is both the most query efficient attack and also the most precise attack. Switching to a different attack algorithm would increase our total experiment cost significantly, and so we do not perform these ablation studies.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Both our hidden-dimension-stealing and entire-layer-stealing attack worked for all five of these models. The size we recover from the model perfectly matches the actual size of the original model, as confirmed by OpenAI. For the first three models, we report in Table 4 the size we recover because (1) the sizes of these models was never previously confirmed, but (2) they have now been deprecated and so disclosing the size is not harmful. In discussions with OpenAI, we decided to withhold disclosure of the size of gpt-3.5-turbo models, but we confirmed with them that the number our attack reported was accurate.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'When running the full layer-stealing attack, we confirmed that our extracted weights are nearly identical to the actual weights, with error \\(<7\\cdot 10^{-4}\\), up to an \\(h\\times h\\) matrix product as discussed previously. Table 4 reports the RMS between our extracted weight matrix and the actual model weights, after "aligning" the two by an \\(h\\times h\\) transform.\n' +

      '## 8 Defenses\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It would be possible to prevent or mitigate this attack in a number of different ways, albeit with loss of functionality.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Prevention\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Remove logit bias.** Perhaps the simplest defense would be to outright remove the logit bias parameter from the API. Unfortunately, there are several legitimate use cases of this parameter. For example, several works use logit bias in order to perform controlled or constrained generation (Jiang et al., 2023; Yang and Klein, 2021), to shift generation and mimic fine-tuning the model (Liu et al., 2024; Mitchell et al., 2024), or other reasons (Ren et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Replace logit bias with a block-list.** Instead of offering a logit bias, model developers could replace it with a block-list of tokens the model is prohibited from emitting. This would support (some) of the functionality discussed in the prior section, but would still prevent our attack.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Architectural changes.** Instead of modifying the API, we could instead make changes to the model. Our attack only works because the hidden dimension \\(h\\) is less than the output dimension \\(l\\). This suggests a natural architectural defense: split the final layer into two layers, one that goes from \\(h\\to t\\) and then \\(t\\to l\\) where \\(t>l\\) and a nonlinearity was placed in between. This is not very efficient though, as the last linear layer is large (quadratic in the vocabulary size).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Post-hoc altering the architecture.** We can also modify the hidden dimension \\(h\\) for the final layer after the model is trained. In particular, we can expand the dimensionality of \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) by concatenating extra weight vectors that are orthogonal to the original matrix. We set the singular values for\n' +

Then, during the model\'s forward pass, we concatenate a vector of random Gaussian noise to the final hidden vector \\(g_{\\theta}(p)\\) before multiplying by \\(\\mathbf{W}\\). Figure 7 shows an example of this, where we expand GPT-2 small to appear as if it was 1024 dimensional instead of 768 dimensions. This misleads the adversary into thinking that the model is wider than it actually is.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Mitigations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Logit bias XOR logprobs.Our attack is \\(10\\times\\) cheaper when an adversary can supply both a logit bias and also view output logprobs. This suggests a natural mitigation: prohibit queries to the API that make use of _both_ logit bias and logprobs at the same time. This type of defense is common in both the security and machine learning community: for example, in 2023 OpenAI removed the ability to combine both echo and logprobs, but with either alone being allowed; this defense would behave similarly.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Noise addition.By adding a sufficient amount of noise to the output logits of any given query, it would be possible to prevent our attack. However, logit-noise has the potential to make models less useful. We perform some preliminary experiments on this direction in Appendix H.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rate limits on logit bias.Our attack requires that we are able to learn at least \\(h\\) logit values for each prompt \\(p\\). One defense would be to allow logit-bias queries to the model, but only allow \\(T=\\tilde{h}/5\\) logit bias queries for any given prompt \\(p\\) to prevent an adversary from learning if a model has hidden dimension \\(\\tilde{h}\\) or smaller.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Unfortunately this has several significant drawbacks: the threshold has to be independent of \\(h\\) (or learning the threshold would reveal \\(h\\)); the system would need to maintain state of all user queries to the API; and preventing Sybil attacks requires a global pool of user queries, which can present significant privacy risks (Debenedetti et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Detect malicious queries.Instead of preventing any queries that might leak model weights, an alternate strategy could be to implement standard anti-abuse tools to _detect_ any patterns of malicious behavior. Several proposals of this form exist for prior machine learning attacks, including model stealing (Juuti et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2021) and adversarial examples (Chen et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 9 Future Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We are motivated to study this problem not because we expect to be able to steal an entire production transformer model bit-for-bit, but because we hope to conclusively demonstrate that model stealing attacks are not just of academic concern but can be practically applied to the largest production models deployed today. We see a number of potential directions for improving on this attack.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Breaking symmetry with quantized weights.Large production models are typically stored "quantized", where each weight is represented in just 4 or 8 bits. In principle, this quantization could allow an adversary to recover a nearly bit-for-bit copy of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}\\): while there exist an infinite number of matrices \\(\\mathbf{W}\\cdot\\mathbf{G}\\), only one will be discretized properly. Unfortunately, this integer-constrained problem is NP-hard in general (similar problems are the foundation for an entire class of public key cryptosystems). But this need not imply that the problem is hard on all instances.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Extending this attack beyond a single layer.Our attack recovers a single layer of a transformer. We see no obvious methodology to extend it beyond just a single layer, due to the non-linearity of the models. But we invite further research in this area.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Removing the logit bias assumption.All our attacks require the ability to pass a logit bias. Model providers including Google and OpenAI provided this capability when we began the writing of this paper, but this could change.

      'Almost all LLMs that have publicly available architecture details use LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) just before applying the output projection \\(\\mathbf{W}\\)(Biderman, 2024). LayerNorm begins with a centering step, which projects its input onto a \\((h-1)\\)-dimensional subspace (and RMSNorm does not). In theory, this could break our assumption that the rank of the matrix with columns \\(g_{\\theta}\\left(p_{i}\\right)\\) (\\(i=1,...,n\\)) has rank \\(h\\) (Lemma 4.1). In practice, all LLMs we surveyed (Biderman, 2024) enabled the LayerNorm bias, which means the matrices had full rank \\(h\\) (besides GPT-2 Small: see Appendix A).\n' +

We found that the technique required two adjustments before it worked on models with lower than 32-bit precision (it always worked with 32-bit precision). i) We do not subtract \\(\\mathcal{O}\\left(p_{0}\\right)\\) from logits queries, but instead subtract the mean logits over all queries, i.e. \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathcal{O}\\left(p_{i}\\right)\\). Since the average of several points in a common affine subspace still lie on that affine subspace, this doesn\'t change the conclusions from Appendix B.2.1. ii) We additionally found it helped to calculate this mean in lower precision, before casting to 64-bit precision to calculate the compact SVD.\n' +

      'Quantization is a popular strategy for decreasing a model\'s memory footprint and speeding up inference. In addition to these benefits, using lower-precision number representations also effectively adds noise. As noted in Section 8.2, adding noise to the output logits could prevent our attack. A natural question that follows is, does quantization add sufficient noise to make our attack ineffective or more difficult to carry out?\n' +

      'For a simple test, we quantize Llama-7B at both 8-bits and 4-bits, and compare our baseline attack (Section 4.1) to the default 16-bit implementation. We quantize using bitsandbytes(Dettmers et al., 2022), which HuggingFace supports for out-of-the-box quantization of model weights and lower-precision inference (Figure 6). We observe no meaningful differences at different levels of quantization; querying each model results in recovering the same same embedding matrix dimension \\(h\\) in the same number of queries. Given that 8-bit and 4-bit quantization are generally observed to not have a large impact on performance, this is perhaps an unsurprising result; any noise from quantization does not seem to have a meaningful impact on the logits (in the context of our attack).\n' +

      '### Noise\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One natural defense to our attacks is to obfuscate the logits by adding noise. This will naturally induce a tradeoff between utility and vulnerability--more noise will result in less useful outputs, but increase extraction difficulty. We empirically measure this tradeoff in Figure 5(c). We consider noise added directly to the logits, that is consistent between different queries of the same prompt. To simulate this, we directly add noise to our recovered logits, and recompute the extracted embedding matrix. For GPT-2, we measure the RMSE between the true embedding matrix and the embedding matrix extracted with a specific noise level; for ada and babbage, we measure the RMSE between the noisy extracted weights and the weights we extracted in the absence of noise. We normalize all embedding matrices (to have \\(\\ell_{2}\\) norm 1) before measuring RMSE.\n' +
