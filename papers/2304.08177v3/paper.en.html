      '###### Abstract\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have dramatically transformed natural language processing research and shown promising strides towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Nonetheless, the high costs associated with training and deploying LLMs present substantial obstacles to transparent, accessible academic research. While several large language models, such as LLaMA, have been open-sourced by the community, these predominantly focus on English corpora, limiting their usefulness for other languages. In this paper, we propose a method to augment LLaMA with capabilities for understanding and generating Chinese text and its ability to follow instructions. We achieve this by extending LLaMA\'s existing vocabulary with an additional 20,000 Chinese tokens, thereby improving its encoding efficiency and semantic understanding of Chinese. We further incorporate secondary pre-training using Chinese data and fine-tune the model with Chinese instruction datasets, significantly enhancing the model\'s ability to comprehend and execute instructions. Our experimental results indicate that the newly proposed model markedly enhances the original LLaMA\'s proficiency in understanding and generating Chinese content. Additionally, the results on the C-Eval dataset yield competitive performance among the models with several times the size of ours. We have made our pre-trained models, training scripts, and other resources available through GitHub, fostering open research for our community.12\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Natural language processing (NLP) field has witnessed a substantial paradigm shift with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, distinguished by their considerable size and comprehensive training data, have demonstrated extraordinary abilities in comprehending and producing human-like text. In contrast to pre-trained language models dedicated to text understanding, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), the GPT series (Radford et al., 2018) accentuates text generation, positioning them as more suitable platforms for creativity compared to their counterparts. Notably, the latest members of the GPT family, namely ChatGPT and GPT-4, have garnered significant attention, establishing themselves as leading examples in this rapidly evolving field.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), evolved from InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), serves as an advanced conversational AI model capable of conducting context-aware, human-like interactions. Its success set the stage for the development of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), a more sophisticated LLM, demonstrating even greater potential in natural language understanding, generation, and various NLP tasks, especially for its multi-modal and reasoning abilities. These models have catalyzed new research directions and applications, intensifying interest in exploring the potential of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Exhibiting impressive performance across multiple benchmarks, they have also demonstrated capabilities for few-shot learning and adaptability to new tasks, significantly driving the expansion of NLP research. Consequently, they have inspired both researchers and industry professionals to further harness their potential across a wide array of applications, including sentiment analysis, machine translation, question-answering systems, and more.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, as impactful as LLMs have been, their implementation comes with inherent limitations that hamper transparent and open research. A major concern is their proprietary nature, which restricts access to the models, thus inhibiting the broader research community\'s ability to build upon their successes. Furthermore, the vast computational resources necessary for training and deploying these models present a challenge for researchers with limited resources, further compounding the accessibility problem.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To tackle these limitations, the NLP research community has gravitated towards open-source alternatives to promote greater transparency and collaboration. LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023a) serve as notable examples of such initiatives. These open-source LLMs are intended to facilitate academic research and accelerate progress within the NLP field. The aim of open-sourcing these models is to foster an environment conducive to further advancements in model development, fine-tuning, and evaluation, ultimately leading to the creation of robust, capable LLMs applicable to a wide variety of uses.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite the considerable strides made by LLaMA and Alpaca in NLP, they exhibit inherent limitations concerning native support for Chinese language tasks. Their vocabularies contain only a few hundred Chinese tokens, substantially hindering their efficiency in encoding and decoding Chinese text. Building on our previous work with the Chinese BERT series (Cui et al., 2021) and Chinese minority-oriented multilingual pre-trained models (Yang et al., 2022), in this technical report, we propose the development of Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca models with enhanced capabilities for understanding and generating Chinese content. We extend the original LLaMA\'s vocabulary with an additional 20,000 Chinese tokens, significantly improving its proficiency in processing and generating Chinese text. To ensure efficient training and deployment of these models, we employ the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach (Hu et al., 2021), enabling us to train and fine-tune the models without excessive computational costs. We anticipate our preliminary study to enhance the Chinese understanding and generation capabilities of LLaMA and Alpaca serves as a foundation for researchers aiming to adapt these models to other languages. By showcasing the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we offer insights and methodologies that can be employed to extend vocabularies and improve the performance of LLaMA and Alpaca models in various languages. An overview of the proposed models is depicted in Figure 1.\n' +

      '## 2 Chinese LLaMA and Chinese Alpaca\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Background\n' +
      '\n' +
      'LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) is a foundational, decoder-only large language model built upon the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Similar to the GPT series and other transformer-based LLMs, LLAMA consists of an embedding layer, multiple transformer blocks, and a language model head. LLAMA also incorporates improvements utilized in different models, such as pre-normalization (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019), SwiGLU activation (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary embeddings (Su et al., 2021). LLaMA is available in four different model sizes: 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'LLaMA has been pre-trained with a standard language modeling task (see Section 2.4) using a mix of publicly available sources, such as crawled web pages, books, Wikipedia, and preprint papers. Experimental findings reveal that LLaMA delivers competitive performance compared to other LLMs like GPT-3, albeit at a smaller model size. This compactness and effectiveness have garnered considerable attention from researchers, leading to the widespread use of LLAMA-based models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Chinese Vocabulary Extension\n' +
      '\n' +
      'LLaMA\'s training set encompasses roughly 1.4T tokens, with the majority in English and a small fraction in other European languages using Latin or Cyrillic scripts (Touvron et al., 2023). Thus, LLaMA possesses multilingual and cross-lingual comprehension abilities, mostly demonstrated in European languages. Interestingly, our prior preliminary study reveals that LLaMA exhibits basic Chinese understanding ability, although its capacity to generate Chinese texts is limited.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To equip LLaMA with enhanced Chinese understanding and generation capabilities, we propose to continue pre-training the LLaMA model with Chinese corpora. However, directly applying continual pre-training with Chinese corpora encounters several challenges. Firstly, the original LLaMA vocabulary covers less than a thousand Chinese characters, which is insufficient to encode general Chinese texts. Although the LLaMA tokenizer circumvents this issue by tokenizing unknown UTF-8 characters to bytes, this strategy significantly extends sequence length and slows down the encoding and decoding efficiency of Chinese texts, as each Chinese character splits into 3-4 byte tokens. Secondly, byte tokens are not exclusively designed to represent Chinese characters. Since byte tokens also signify UTF-8 tokens in other languages, it becomes challenging for byte tokens and transformer encoders to effectively learn representations capturing the semantic meaning of Chinese characters.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To address these problems and improve encoding efficiency, we propose to extend LLaMA vocabulary with additional Chinese tokens and adapt the model for the extended vocabulary (Yang et al., 2022). The extension process proceeds as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'stages. We primarily incorporate LoRA adapters into the weights of the attention module and MLP layers. The effectiveness of applying LoRA to all linear transformer blocks is verified in QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023), indicating that our choices were reasonable.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Pre-Training Objective\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We pre-train the Chinese LLaMA model with the standard Causal Language Modeling (CLM) task. Given an input token sequence \\(\\mathbf{x}=(x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots)\\), the model is trained to predict the next token \\(x_{i}\\) in an autoregressive manner. Mathematically, the objective is to minimize the following negative log-likelihood:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CLM}}(\\Theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{PT} }}\\left[-\\sum_{i}\\log p(x_{i}|x_{0},x_{1},\\ldots,x_{i-1};\\Theta)\\right] \\tag{2}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where, \\(\\Theta\\) represents the model parameters, \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{PT}}\\) is the pre-training dataset, \\(x_{i}\\) is the token to be predicted, and \\(x_{0},x_{1},\\ldots,x_{i-1}\\) constitute the context.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Supervised Fine-Tuning and Chinese Alpaca\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Pre-trained language models can hardly follow user instructions and often generate unintended content. This is because the language modeling objective in Equation (2) is predicting the next token, not "follow the instructions and answer the questions" (Ouyang et al., 2022). To align the behavior of language models to the user\'s intention, one can fine-tune the model to explicitly train it to follow instructions. Stanford Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) is a LLaMA-based instruction-following model that was trained on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022). We follow the approach in Stanford Alpaca to apply self-instructed fine-tuning on Chinese LLaMA to train an instruction-following model -- Chinese Alpaca.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Chinese Alpaca is trained on a combination of instruction-following datasets. Each example in the dataset consists of an instruction and an output. The supervised fine-tuning task is similar to the causal language modeling task: the model is prompted with the instruction and trained to generate the output autoregressively. The instruction is wrapped in a prompt template, and the output immediately follows the template. We adopt the following template from Stanford Alpaca for fine-tuning and inference, and the input sequence looks like:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request._\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_## Instruction:_\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_{instruction}_\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_## Response: {output}_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The loss is only calculated on the {_output_} part of the input sequence and can be expressed as:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SFT}}(\\Theta)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{PT} }}\\left[-\\sum_{i\\in\\{\\text{\\emph{output}}\\}}\\log p(x_{i}|x_{0},x_{1},\\ldots,x _{i-1};\\Theta)\\right] \\tag{3}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Here, \\(\\Theta\\) represents the model parameters, \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{SFT}}\\) is the fine-tuning dataset, \\(\\mathbf{x}=(x_{0},x_{1},\\ldots)\\) represents the tokenized input sequence.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A major difference between our approach and Stanford Alpaca is that we only use the prompt template designed for examples without an _input_ field, whereas Stanford Alpaca employs two templates for examples both with and without an _input_ field. If the example contains a non-empty _input_ field, we concatenate the _instruction_ and _input_ with an "\\(\\backslash\\)" to form the new instruction. Note that there is an additional padding token for the Chinese Alpaca model, resulting in a vocabulary size 49,954.\n' +

      'Experimental Setups\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Experimental Setups for Pre-training\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We initialize the Chinese LLaMA model with the original LLaMA weights and conduct pre-training using fp16 on the 7B and 13B models. Additionally, for the 33B model, we employ the bitsandbytes4 library to train it in an 8-bit format, enhancing its efficiency and memory usage. We directly apply LoRA to attentions and MLPs for training while setting the embeddings and LM head as trainable.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 4: [https://github.com/TimDetmers/bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDetmers/bitsandbytes)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For the basic version of Chinese LLaMA-7B, we utilize a two-stage pre-training approach. In stage 1, we fix the parameters of the transformer encoders within the model and only train the embeddings, adapting the newly added Chinese word vectors while minimizing the disturbance to the original model. In stage 2, we add LoRA weights (adapters) to the attention mechanisms and train the embeddings, LM heads, and newly added LoRA parameters. Note that two-stage training is not applied to other model training as it is less efficient in our preliminary study.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For the other Chinese LLaMA models (basic version), we utilize a 20GB general Chinese corpus for pre-training, which is consistent with the corpora used by Chinese BERT-wvm (Cui et al., 2021), MacBERT (Cui et al., 2020), LERT (Cui et al., 2022), and others. We also provide "Plus" version, which further expands the pre-training data to 120GB, incorporating additional data from CommonCrawl (CC) and encyclopedia sources, enhancing the model\'s understanding of fundamental concepts. We concatenated all the datasets and generated chunks of block size 512 for pre-training purposes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The models are trained on A40 GPUs (48GB VRAM) for one epoch, taking up to 48 GPUs depending on the model size. The parameter-efficient training with LoRA is performed with PEFT library5. We also utilize DeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) to optimize memory efficiency during the training process. We employ the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) with a peak learning rate of 2e-4 and 5% warm-up cosine scheduler. Additionally, we apply gradient clipping with a value of 1.0 to mitigate potential gradient explosion.\n' +

However, GPT-4 may not always provide accurate scores, so we perform manual checks on its ratings and adjust them if necessary.

      '### Experimental Setups for Decoding\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The decoding process of LLMs plays a critical role in determining the quality and diversity of the generated text. In our experiments, we use the following decoding hyperparameters:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Context size: We set the context size to 2048, which determines the maximum number of tokens the model can consider simultaneously when generating text.\n' +
      '* Maximum sequence length: We limit the generated sequence length to 512 tokens to ensure that the outputs remain focused and relevant to the input prompt.\n' +
      '* Temperature: We set the temperature to 0.2, which controls the randomness of the sampling process. Lower values make the model generate more focused and deterministic outputs, while higher values increase diversity at the cost of coherence. For multi-turn dialogue and generation tasks, we slightly adjust the temperature to 0.5 to allow a more diverse output.\n' +
      '* Top-\\(k\\) sampling: We use Top-\\(k\\) sampling with \\(k=40\\), meaning that the model selects its next token from the top 40 most probable tokens at each step, adding an element of randomness and diversity to the generated text.\n' +
      '* Top-\\(p\\) sampling: We also employ Top-\\(p\\) sampling with \\(p=0.9\\), which further enhances diversity by considering a dynamic set of tokens that collectively account for 90% of the probability mass.\n' +
      '* Repetition penalty: To discourage the model from generating repetitive text, we apply a repetition penalty with a factor of 1.1, penalizing tokens that have already been selected.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that these values may not be optimal for each testing scenario. We did not perform further tuning on these hyperparameters for each task to maintain a balanced view.\n' +

      'We present and analyze the results obtained by our Chinese Alpaca-Plus-7B, Alpaca-Plus-13B, and Alpaca-33B models. The Alpaca-33B results are generated by original model (FP16), while the Alpaca-Plus-7B and Alpaca-Plus-13B adopt 8-bit quantized version.8 The overall results are shown in Table 4. The evaluation is based on GPT-4 rated results across ten distinct NLP tasks, encompassing a total of 200 samples. It is important to note that the presented scores are solely comparable with each other but not with other models, which would require resorting the systems. Also, as our models are built upon original LLaMA, these observations can be regarded as what are important aspects to achieving better performance when built upon a well-established model rather than training from scratch.

      '\n' +
      'One of the impressive achievements of ChatGPT is its rich and fluent contextual understanding ability, which is conveyed by the multi-turn dialogue interface. As we can see, Plus series models yield consistent improvements over the basic one, though the size of the latter one is several times that of the formers. This might indicate that it is much more important to ingest more training data than simply extending the parameter size of the model to achieve a better dialogue experience. Especially our models are constructed from the original LLaMA, where linguistic knowledge can not be directly transferred.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.3.2 Text Generation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Text generation is one of the most fundamental abilities for language models. Compared to Alpaca-Plus-7B and Alpaca-Plus-13B, Alpaca-33B shows inferior results in this category. Table 5 shows an example of a text generation task. We can see that both Alpaca-Plus-7B and Alpaca-Plus-13B provide correct letter styles, which meet the requirement of the user\'s prompt. Alpaca-Plus-13B provides the most comprehensive one by indicating that the applicant has thoroughly prepared all materials for visa application, making it the best generation quality among all three systems. However, Alpaca-33B does not follow the letter style, and the content is somewhat too simplified, which is clearly not as good as the others. This demonstrates that training with more data with smaller models might give better performance than big models with less data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.3.3 Numerical Calculation and Reasoning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Numerical reasoning has been regarded as one of the most essential tasks in examining the reasoning ability of large language models. As we can see, the Alpaca-33B achieves significant improvements over Plus-7B and Plus-13B models. Table 6 shows example outputs for this task. The first prompt is well-known for probing the reasoning ability, namely "which one is heavier, 1kg of cotton or 1kg of iron?". Both Plus-7B and Plus-13B failed to give a correct answer mentioning that "cotton is lighter than iron". However, 33B could correctly identify that these two things are the same weight. The second prompt is a simple calculation task, asking "how many legs for a cat and a chicken". However, as we can see, both Plus-7B and Plus-13B do not have the commonsense knowledge that a cat has four legs and two for a chicken, resulting in wrong answers. The last prompt is a numerical reasoning task to let the model predict the next number of an array. Still, only 33B model correctly identifies the pattern of the given array that the next number should be the square of its index. These observations indicate that the size of the model is vital in numerical reasoning tasks.\n' +

      'with less data. Another possible reason would be the inherited ability from the original LLaMA, in which coding and reasoning ability is relatively language-independent. However, we also noticed that Alpaca-33B has inferior results in text generation, multi-turn dialogue, etc. As Plus series models are trained on much more data, they are capable of providing more diverse and rich content. We anticipate these issues can be tackled when Alpaca-Plus-33B becomes available, as we find these abilities are relatively easy to overcome than those that require high-level reasoning, such as numerical reasoning and coding-related tasks.

To map the probability distribution to a valid label \\(t\\) in {A, B, C, D}, we extract and gather the probabilities of related tokens.

      '### Comparisons to Original LLaMA\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 3 demonstrates how our models evolve based on the original LLaMA. Detailed results are depicted in Table 8. We mainly describe our findings in the following aspects.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Chinese LLaMA improves original LLaMA.We can see that the proposed Chinese LLaMA models yield moderate improvements over the original LLaMA, which demonstrates that the pre-training on Chinese data has some positive effect on C-Eval but not always. When we compare Chinese LLaMA and LLaMA-Plus, the latter does not show significant improvements over the former one, even showing inferior results for 13B setting. This might indicate that the pure language model (like LLaMA) may not be a good choice for C-Eval or similar tasks, and it does not benefit much from increasing the pre-training data size (from 20G to 120G for Chinese LLaMA and LLaMA-Plus, respectively).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 3: **Results on C-Eval valid set. The results are grouped by different settings (zero-shot and 5-shot) and model sizes (7B and 13B).**\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Alpaca models show significant improvements over LLaMA.Among different settings, such as zero-shot or 5-shot, the Alpaca model series show significant improvements over LLaMA counterparts, demonstrating that the instruction-following models are more capable of handling these NLU-like tasks than pure language models. Unlike the phenomenon observed in the LLaMA series, we can see that Alpaca-Plus models yield significant improvement over basic Alpaca models. This might further indicate that instruction-following models are more capable of handling NLU-like tasks and can unlesah the power of using more pre-training data (LLaMA-Plus).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'LLaMA generally yields better performance in a few-shot setting, while Alpaca prefers zero-shot.Generally speaking, LLaMA with 5-shot setting shows better performance than zero-shot setting, while Alpaca with zero-shot setting is much better than 5-shot one. As LLaMA is not designed for instruction-following, few-shot setting might give valuable information on how to follow the question answering structure in C-Eval. However, on the contrary, as Alpaca has already been trained with millions of instruction data, it is less likely to benefit from additional shots. Also, the official 5-shot setting uses identical prompts for all samples, making it some distraction for Alpaca models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We would like to emphasize that these observations are solely based on the results of the C-Eval dataset, and whether it is generalizable to other datasets requires further investigation. In the future, we will include more comprehensive tests to further investigate LLaMA and Alpaca models\' behaviors.\n' +

      '## 6 Effect of Different Quantization Methods\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Deploying large language models on personal computers, particularly on CPUs, has historically been challenging due to their immense computational requirements. However, with the help of many community efforts, such as llama.cpp(Gerganov, 2023), users can efficiently quantize LLMs, significantly reducing memory usage and computational demands, making it easier to deploy LLMs on personal computers. This also enables quicker interactions with the models and facilitates local data processing. Quantizing LLMs and deploying them on personal computers offer several benefits. Firstly, it helps users protect their data privacy by ensuring that sensitive information remains within their local environment rather than being transmitted to external servers. Secondly, it democratizes access to LLMs by making them more accessible to users with limited computational resources. Lastly, it promotes the development of new applications and research directions that take advantage of local LLM deployments. Overall, the ability to deploy LLMs on personal computers using 1lama.cpp (or similar) paves the way for a more versatile and privacy-conscious utilization of LLMs in various domains.\n' +

      'In this section, we investigate the effect of different quantization methods. We use llama.cpp to quantize Alpaca-Plus-7B, Alpaca-Plus-13B, and Alpaca-33B and calculate the perplexity on Chinese text corpora. We quantize these models into 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit forms to compare with the original FP16 one.10 The results are shown in Figure 4.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The quantization level is strictly bound to the memory usage and inference speed, and thus a trade-off must be made when choosing a proper quantization level. As we can see, the 8-bit quantization method has almost the same or even lower perplexities compared to the original FP16 model, demonstrating that it is a good choice for deploying LLMs on personal computers, with only half size of the FP16 one. The 6-bit models also achieve decent PPLs comparable to the 8-bit one, making it a better balance of speed and performance. When we use a more aggressive quantization level, the performance drastically decreases (i.e., higher PPL), especially for 3-bit and 2-bit. We also discover that larger models are less sensitive to quantization methods than smaller ones. For example, the performance of 33B models changes much more mildly than the others. A similar result is also observed when comparing Plus-7B and Plus-13B models. This might indicate that though 2-bit and 3-bit quantization are less effective for smaller models, it might be a promising way to deploy larger models without significant performance loss. This is extremely helpful when the users only have limited computing resources and still want to try large language models. This might also imply that the quantized training method may become a main-stream approach for training large language models, especially for those with limited training resources.\n' +

      '## 7 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this technical report, we have presented an approach to enhance the Chinese understanding and generation capabilities of the LLaMA model. Acknowledging the limitations of the original LLaMA\'s Chinese vocabulary, we expanded it by incorporating 20K additional Chinese tokens, significantly increasing its encoding efficiency for the Chinese language. Building on the Chinese LLaMA, we employed supervised fine-tuning with instruction data, resulting in Chinese Alpaca models exhibiting improved instruction-following capabilities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To evaluate our models effectively, we annotated 200 samples across ten distinct task types and utilized GPT-4 for evaluation. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed models significantly outperformed the original LLaMA in Chinese understanding and generation tasks. We also tested our models on C-Eval datasets. The results show that the proposed model could achieve significant improvements and show competitive performance to the models with several times bigger sizes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Looking ahead, we plan to explore Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Reinforcement Learning from AI Instructed Feedback (RLAIF) to further align the models\' output with human preferences. Moreover, we intend to adopt more advanced and effective quantization methods, such as GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2022), among others. Additionally, we aim to investigate alternative methods to LoRA for more efficient and effective pre-training and fine-tuning of large lan\n' +

      '## Limitations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While this project has successfully enhanced the Chinese understanding and generation capabilities of the LLaMA and Alpaca models, several limitations must be acknowledged:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Harmful and unpredictable content: Though our model can reject unethical queries, these models may still generate harmful or misaligned with human preferences and values. This issue may arise from biases in the training data or the models\' inability to discern appropriate outputs in certain contexts.\n' +
      '* Insufficient training: Due to constraints in computing power and data availability, the training of the models may not be sufficient for optimal performance. As a result, there is still room for improvement in the Chinese understanding capabilities of the models.\n' +
      '* Lack of robustness: The models may exhibit brittleness in some situations, producing inconsistent or nonsensical outputs when faced with adversarial inputs or rare language phenomena.\n' +
      '* Comprehensive evaluation: Evaluating large language models is an important topic in the current era. While we have seen many evaluation benchmarks for LLMs, their comprehensiveness and appropriateness for LLMs should be well-studied and examined. A more diverse and comprehensive LLM evaluation dataset and benchmark will have a great positive effect on shaping the future of LLM research.\n' +
      '* Scalability and efficiency: Although we applied LoRA and quantization to make the model more accessible to a broader community, when combined with the original LLaMA, the models\' large size and complexity can lead to difficulties in deployment, especially for users with limited computational resources. This issue may hinder the accessibility and widespread adoption of the models in various applications.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Future work should address these limitations to further enhance the models\' capabilities, making them more robust, accessible, and effective for a broader range of applications in the Chinese NLP community.\n' +
