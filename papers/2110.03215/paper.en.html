      '\n' +
      'Large Language Models (LMs) are known to encode world knowledge in their parameters as they pretrain on a vast amount of web corpus, which is often utilized for performing knowledge-dependent downstream tasks such as question answering, fact-checking, and open dialogue. In real-world scenarios, the world knowledge stored in the LMs can quickly become outdated as the world changes, but it is non-trivial to avoid catastrophic forgetting and reliably acquire new knowledge while preserving invariant knowledge. To push the community towards better maintenance of ever-changing LMs, we formulate a new continual learning (CL) problem called Continual Knowledge Learning (CKL). We construct a new benchmark and metric to quantify the retention of time-invariant world knowledge, the update of outdated knowledge, and the acquisition of new knowledge. We adopt applicable recent methods from literature to create several strong baselines. Through extensive experiments, we find that CKL exhibits unique challenges that are not addressed in previous CL setups, where parameter expansion is necessary to reliably retain and learn knowledge simultaneously. By highlighting the critical causes of knowledge forgetting, we show that CKL is a challenging and important problem that helps us better understand and train ever-changing LMs. The benchmark datasets, model checkpoints, and code to reproduce our results are available at this https URL.\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recent works have shown that large Language Models (LM), such as T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), have the capability of storing a tremendous amount of world knowledge in their parameters when pretrained on a vast corpus of text (Petroni et al., 2019). These pretrained LMs have shown potential to serve as knowledge bases when probed for world knowledge without any finetuning through the LAnguage Model Analysis (LAMA) task (Petroni et al., 2019), which requires probing LMs for world knowledge in a zero-shot manner through slot-filling, and promising results utilizing the encoded world knowledge when finetuned on various Knowledge Intensive Language Tasks (KILT) (Petroni et al., 2021), e.g., question answering, knowledgeable open dialogues.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While the world knowledge stored in LMs has diverse use cases, it can quickly become outdated as the world changes fast, and LMs need to frequently renew their internal world knowledge accordingly. For example, it is impossible to probe for _new_ information such as "_- _won the US Election 2020_" from the original T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) which was pretrained on C4 web corpus from April 2019.1 Also, information that may have once been considered accurate may no longer be valid because the information has been _updated_. For instance, the answer to "_Which soccer team does Cristiano Ronaldo play for?_" has changed from _Juventus_ to _Manchester United_ in September 2021. Meanwhile, _time-invariant_ information learned from the original corpus such as "_Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii_" should not be altered within the LMs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: T5 was initially pretrained on the C4 dataset (about 750 GB), which is a cleansed dump of Common Crawl extracted from the web in April 2019.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite its importance, the challenge of renewing the internal world knowledge stored in the parameters of LMs is nontrivial and has only been explored in rather specific settings. For example, recent works have proposed to modify specific target knowledge such as individual facts (De Cao et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2021). Dhingra et al. (2021) have addressed LMs as temporal knowledge bases by jointly modeling text with its timestamp. But the problem of renewing the world knowledge of LMs in a more general and scalable way, such as through continual pretraining on a corpus with new knowledge, has not been formally formulated or explored by previous works. Moreover, the community lacks a benchmark that can be used to systematically study how the internal knowledge of LMs changes through the training on new information. Lastly, methodologies to effectively renew the knowledge of LMs at scale have yet to be thoroughly explored.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this work, we propose a novel continual learning (CL) formulation named Continual KnowledgeLearning (CKL), where we attempt to renew the internal world knowledge of LMs through continual pretraining on new corpora. We systematically categorize world knowledge into three main categories and make benchmark datasets to measure each of them during CKL: (1) InvariantLAMA for _time-invariant_ world knowledge in LMs that should not be forgotten or altered, (2) UpdatedLAMA for outdated world knowledge that needs to be _updated_ in the LMs, and (3) NewLAMA for _new_ world knowledge that should be injected into the LMs. We also propose a novel metric named FUAR (Forgotten / (Updated + Acquired) Ratio) that can measure the trade-off between forgetting, updating, and acquiring knowledge. Finally, while one might think of implementing contemporary CL methods for this benchmark, we show that CKL has nontrivial differences to traditional CL formulations and require approaches specific to CKL. We find and compare model architectures and training methodologies (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021b) from the literature that have shown potential to mitigate forgetting of knowledge gained during pretraining, establishing them as baselines for the CKL benchmark.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In sum, while the challenge of renewing the internal world knowledge of LMs is essential in real-world scenarios, it has yet to be formulated or extensively explored. Therefore, in this paper:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* We propose a novel CL formulation called Continual Knowledge Learning (CKL) and construct a new benchmark to measure the amount of forgetting and amount of world knowledge gained by continued pretraining on a novel language modeling corpus that we construct, containing new knowledge.\n' +
      '* We explore LM architectures and training methodologies that are natural baselines for CKL in literature, denoting them as CKL methods, and performing extensive experiments on our CKL benchmark. We categorize them into regularization, rehearsal, and parameter-expansion methods, same as in traditional CL literature, and compare the effectiveness of each type of method using a novel metric named FUAR that we propose to measure the trade-off between forgotten knowledge and updated or acquired knowledge.\n' +
      '* Towards creating an ever-changing LM, we perform extensive analysis in the CKL benchmark and highlight important challenges and findings: parameter-expansion methods have the limitation of memory inefficiency despite performing the best in most of our experiments and seeing the same data repeatedly during continued pretraining is a critical cause of forgetting. Also, we show interesting results that need further exploration: learning rate can be varied to balance the forgetting and learning of new knowledge, CKL may help in\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Language Models (LMs) utilizing knowledge from external sources, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) and Blender Bot 2.0 (Xu et al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2021), cope with the changing world by updating the external sources during inference or searching the internet for retrieving recent information. However, recent works have shown that these memory-augmented models suffer from _hallucination_, which means that they present false information as if it were correct, despite being given updated knowledge during inference (Zhang and Choi, 2021), which worsens as the size of the LM increases (Longpre et al., 2021), making it more so important for implicit parameters to be renewed as well.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In order to renew the internal knowledge of LMs, one might consider pretraining LMs from scratch with a newly updated text corpus of a scale similar to the one used during initial pretraining, such as a recent dump of the entire Wikipedia. However, this approach is computationally demanding and also environmentally harmful (Patterson et al., 2021). Another alternative approach is continuing the pretraining process on a much smaller corpus containing new world knowledge, but such a methodology is known to suffer from _catastrophic forgetting_(McCloskey and Cohen, 1989; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), where the models forget previously learned knowledge as they acquire new knowledge.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Lazaridou et al. (2021); Jin et al. (2021) suggests implementing prior Continual Learning (CL) methods (Sun et al., 2020; d\'Autume et al., 2019) to address this problem. However, it is important to note that there are nontrivial differences between traditional CL and the proposed Continual Knowledge Learning (CKL) formulation which make applying traditional CL methods inadequate. In traditional CL, methods can be largely categorized into _regularization_, _rehearsal_, and _parameter-expansion_ methods. (1) While regularization methods (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) require identifying important parameters used for previous tasks, exactly how and where the knowledge is stored in the parameters of an LM is currently extremely difficult to identify and localize (Vig et al., 2020; De Cao et al., 2021). (2) While prior rehearsal methods (Lopez-Paz and Ranzato, 2017) consider learning all of the streams of tasks at once (multi-task learning) as the performance upper-bound and replicate such a setting with samples stored in the episodic memory, a few samples from the pretraining corpus cannot represent the overall world knowledge from the corpus. Moreover, if LMs are pretrained on a shuffled concatenation of stream of corpora, there is no guarantee that the LMs will acquire the correct, recent information from the recent corpora, especially in cases where the former corpora are much bigger than the latter ones, which is shown by experiments in Section 5.1. (3) Lastly, prior parameter-expansion methods (Rusu et al., 2016; Yoon et al., 2018) focus on _learning a stream of different tasks via strong supervision_, while in CKL, the focus is _constantly updating world knowledge from a stream of corpora via self-supervision_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Because of these fundamental differences, instead of contemporary CL methods mentioned above, we explore methodologies from the literature that are suitable for CKL (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021), modifying and adapting each method according to our needs as CKL methods. Lastly, while it has been pointed out that some of the traditional CL formulations may have little practical importance in real-world scenarios by Prabhu et al. (2020), CKL is much closer to the initial motivation behind CL, which is that the "fundamental characteristic of natural intelligence is its ability to continually learn new knowledge while updating information about the old ones" (Prabhu et al., 2020). Details of related works regarding the traditional CL methods and how CKL methods address the fundamental differences are provided in Appendix A.\n' +

      'In this section, we explain the formulation of the task, the data construction process, and the proposed metric measuring the trade-off between forgetting previous world knowledge and updating and learning of new world knowledge.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Task Formulation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'When viewing the task of renewing the internal knowledge of LMs as one of CL formulations, pretraining on the original corpus can be considered as a _previous task_, and continued pretraining on new corpus can be considered as the _current task_, the main objective becoming retaining the _time-invariant_ world knowledge gained through initial pretraining while efficiently learning _new_ and _updated_ world knowledge through continued pretraining. Throughout the paper, we let \\(D_{0}\\) refer to the corpus used for initial pretraining and let \\(D_{1}\\) denote the new corpus used for continued pretraining.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'New Text Corpus for Language ModelingFor LMs to renew their internal knowledge, they need to be continually pretrained on a new text corpus \\(D_{1}\\) which has the updated and new information. \\(D_{1}\\) should ideally be much smaller than \\(D_{0}\\), as a large \\(D_{1}\\) amounting to the size of \\(D_{0}\\) will result in massive computational costs similar to pretraining the LMs from scratch. For constructing \\(D_{1}\\), we crawl recently published news articles from the web making CC-RecentNews.2\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 2: CC-RecentNews consists of 221,779 articles (\\(\\sim\\)168M tokens), which is estimated to be about 750 times smaller than C4, a cleansed version of the April 2019 Common Crawl dataset ([https://commoncrawl.org/](https://commoncrawl.org/)) that was used to initially pretrain the T5 LM (Raffel et al., 2019).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Probing LMs for World KnowledgeThe most widely used task for probing LMs for world knowledge is the LAnguage Model Analysis (LAMA) (Petroni et al., 2019) task, which consists of cloze sentences created from a set of knowledge sources using manually defined templates. We define that an LM _knows_ a fact if it can successfully predict in a zero-shot manner the masked entity in the cloze sentence, such as "_Dante was born in_." as _Florence_. While there may be other alternatives for measuring the world knowledge encoded in LMs3, we construct our main datasets as LAMA tasks, while also additionally providing the corresponding question pairs to the cloze sentences for those who want to test on CBQA as well.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 3: Closed-book question answering (CBQA) (Roberts et al., 2020) can also be considered as a task that measures the world knowledge of LMs through finetuning, but it has been pointed out that much of its performance increases are due to the test-train overlap (Lewis et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) in the datasets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Measuring Retention of Time-invariant World KnowledgeWe define _time-invariant_ world knowledge as the information present in \\(D_{0}\\) that has no possibility of conflicting with information from \\(D_{1}\\). For example, if the information of the _birthplace of Barack Obama_ is present in \\(D_{0}\\), it is unlikely that \\(D_{1}\\) contains information that contradicts that fact. Also, we classify instances where the time-stamps are fixed such as "_Cristiano Ronaldo played for_. _in 2010_." as _time-invariant_. These _time-invariant_ instances should not be changed as LMs are continually pretrained on \\(D_{1}\\). In order to measure how much _time-invariant_ information is lost due to _catastrophic forgetting_ during continued pretraining, we create InvariantLAMA, a subset of LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019), consisting of only _time-invariant_ cloze sentences detailed in Appendix B.1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Measuring Update of Outdated World KnowledgeIn this work, we define _outdated_ world knowledge as information that is conflicting between \\(D_{0}\\) and \\(D_{1}\\). For example, the President of the US may be _Barack Obama_ in \\(D_{0}\\) and _Joe Biden_ in \\(D_{1}\\). In this case, the LM should update its internal knowledge as _Joe Biden_ as the US president. If an LM is pretrained on both \\(D_{0}\\) and \\(D_{1}\\) simultaneously, there is no guarantee that the LM will acquire the correct, recent information from \\(D_{1}\\), especially in cases where \\(D_{0}\\) is much bigger than \\(D_{1}\\), which is one of the biggest difference between the CKL and traditional CL setting. For measuring _update_ of outdated information, we construct UpdatedLAMA which is made up of cloze statements for which answers can be found in both \\(D_{0}\\) and \\(D_{1}\\), but are conflicting.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Measuring Acquisition of New World KnowledgeWe define _new_ world knowledge as the information present in \\(D_{1}\\), but not in \\(D_{0}\\). To measure _new_ knowledge acquired through continued pretraining on \\(D_{1}\\), we construct NewLAMA which is made up of detailed cloze statements requiring _new_ knowledge from \\(D_{1}\\) to correctly answer. We provide two datasets for measuring _new world knowledge_: NewLAMA, for which each of the instances is verified that the answer does not exist in \\(D_{0}\\), but only in \\(D_{1}\\), and NewLAMA-Easy for which each of the instances does not perfectly comply with our strict definition of _new_ world knowledge due to its creation process, but is used to generally measure the new knowledge acquired from continued pretraining on \\(D_{1}\\) at a larger scale.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'NewLAMA-Easy can be considered _easier_ since each instance was constructed to be similar to the data distribution seen during continued pretraining.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Dataset ConstructionThe data for continual pretraining, CC-RecentNews, is constructed using news-please (Hamborg et al., 2017). InvariantLAMA is constructed by manually selecting 28 _time-invariant_ relations from T-Rex (Elsahar et al., 2018). For UpdatedLAMA and NewLAMA, we use Amazon Mechanical Turk (mturk)4 for crowd-sourcing Human Intelligent Tasks (HITs). The process requires selecting answerable questions from a list of questions generated by the model introduced in Lewis et al. (2021) and converting them into clozse sentences. We have also separately hired 11 experts to verify the correctness and search the C4 database to categorize each instance following our definition of _updated_ and _new_. NewLAMA-Easy is constructed at a larger scale through a two-phase mturk process where sentences selected from articles containing new information are decontextualized and paraphrased5 before being masked, verified and converted to corresponding questions. The constructed dataset statistics are in Table 1. Important details about the data construction pipeline, examples, and more fine-grained statistics are provided in Appendix B.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We propose a novel metric, **FUAR** (**F**rorgottes / (**U**pdated + **A**cquired) **R**atio), that can compare the efficiency of each CKL method using the trade-off between forgotten time-invariant knowledge and updated or newly acquired knowledge. FUAR represents relatively _how many_ time-invariant knowledge instances are forgotten in order to learn _one_ new or updated knowledge instance. We first define FUAR for the general case where there can be multiple corpora used for training an ever-changing LM.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Let \\(T\\) be an arbitrary task and \\((D_{i})_{i=0}^{n}\\) be a sequence of corpora used for LM pretraining, where \\(D_{0}\\) is the initial pretraining corpus. We define \\(\\text{Gap}(T,D_{a},D_{b})=Score(T)\\) of \\(LM_{a}-Score(T)\\) of \\(LM_{b}\\), where \\(LM_{a}\\) represents the LM after being pretrained on \\(D_{a}\\). Then, we denote \\(\\mathbb{T}^{F}=(T_{i}^{F})_{i=0}^{n-1}\\) as a sequence of tasks from \\((D_{i})_{i=0}^{n-1}\\) measuring the forgetting of invariant-knowledge from each corresponding corpus. If there is no such task from corpus \\(D_{i}\\), the value of \\(T_{i}^{F}\\) is set to \\(n.d.\\), which means _not defined_. Likewise, we denote \\(T_{n}^{U}\\) and \\(T_{n}^{A}\\) as tasks from \\(D_{n}\\) measuring the _update_ and _acquisition_ of new knowledge, respectively. We define FUAR as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\text{FUAR}(\\mathbb{T}^{F},T_{n}^{U},T_{n}^{A})=\\begin{cases}\\sum\\limits_{i=0 }^{n-1}\\max(0,\\text{Gap}(T_{i}^{F},D_{i},D_{n}))\\mathbb{1}_{\\{T_{i}^{F}\\neq n.d.\\}}\\\\ \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}\\{\\max(0,\\text{Gap}(T_{n}^{U},D_{n},D_{i}))\\mathbb{1}_{ \\{T_{i}^{F}\\neq n.d.\\}}+\\max(0,\\text{Gap}(T_{n}^{A},D_{n},D_{i}))\\mathbb{1}_{ \\{T_{i}^{F}\\neq n.d.\\}}\\}\\\\ \\text{if denominator }>0,\\\\ \\text{no gain, otherwise}.\\end{cases} \\tag{1}\\]\n' +

      'The choice of benchmark tasks \\(\\mathbb{T}^{F}\\), \\(T_{n}^{U}\\), and \\(T_{n}^{A}\\) can differ according to each experimental setup. FUAR value of 1.0 represents an equal trade-off scenario where _one_ time-invariant knowledge instance of \\(\\mathbb{T}^{F}\\) is forgotten on average to gain one new or updated knowledge instance of \\(T_{n}^{U}\\) and \\(T_{n}^{A}\\). The two terms in the denominators are summed because newly gained knowledge and updated knowledge are mutually exclusive by definition. When the value is smaller than 1, it means that the model obtains more new or updated knowledge than the amount of forgotten knowledge, so methods\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We perform extensive experiments with an encoder-decoder model, T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), a large LM (\\(\\sim\\) 737M params) initially pretrained on April 2019 dump of C4 and May 2020 dump of Wikipedia (thus \\(D_{0}\\) in our experiments) with salient span masking (SSM). The details of the pretraining, continual pretraining, and evaluation configurations are in Appendix C. We establish the following methods as the baselines for the CKL benchmark and categorize them into _regularization_, _rehearsal_, and _parameter-expansion_ methods. The specific hyperparamters used for the implementation of each method are detailed in Appendix D.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Initial** refers to the setting where we evaluate the LM before any continued pretraining. The performance of this model can be considered as the _upper-bound_ for InvariantLAMA and _lower-bound_ on UpdatedLAMA and NewLAMA.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Vanilla** is a specific setting of further pretraining (Gururangan et al., 2020), where the domain is _new_ knowledge, and the LM is further pretrained without any training strategies.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**RecAdam**(Chen et al., 2020) falls into the category of regularization methods. It places a stronger independent assumption among the model parameters than the traditional regularization method (EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017)) and does not access the initial pretraining corpus to regularize the model weights during continued pretraining. The optimizer is annealed so that less regularization is applied as the training progresses.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Mix-Review**(He et al., 2021) falls into the category of rehearsal methods, which assumes access to the initial pretraining corpus and mixes in random subsets of the initial pretraining data during continued pretraining, depending on the mix-ratio at the current time step. As the training progresses, the mix-ratio decays towards 0, decreasing the amount of the mixed original data at each iteration.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**LoRA**(Hu et al., 2021) falls into the category of parameter-expansion methods. It freezes the original parameters of the LM and adds trainable rank-decomposition matrices into each layer that are updated during continued pretraining. Hu et al. (2021) has implemented this approach with decoder-only models (GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) & GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)) while we apply it to an encoder-decoder model, denoting it as T5-LoRA.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**K-Adapter**(Wang et al., 2021) is another parameter-expansion method that freezes the original parameters of the LM while adding \\(k\\) number of new layers, namely _adapters_, that are updated during continued pretraining. Wang et al. (2021) have shown successful injection of _factual_ and _linguistic_ knowledge for encoder-only models, BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) & RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), while we also apply it to an encoder-decoder model, T5, and decoder-only model, GPT-2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Modular** is a newly proposed parameter-expansion method specifically for encoder-decoder models which freezes the original, pretrained encoder while adding a new, randomly initialized encoder that is updated during continued pretraining. For the newly added encoder, we vary the size to _T5-small_ while keeping the size of the original encoder and decoder to be _T5-large_.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'In this section, we first show the main experimental results for the CKL Benchmark. Then, since multiple steps of continual knowledge learning, i.e., CKL are needed for training a true, ever-changing LM, we explore the effects of multiple CKL phases as well as how epochs, corpus size, and the total number of training steps affect CKL. We further explore how learning rates affect CKL in Appendix E, how continual pretraining on \\(D_{1}\\) affects the performance of KILT tasks which re quire knowledge from \\(D_{0}\\) in Appendix F, how CKL methods transfer across LM architectures in Appendix G, and how the prediction outputs change during CKL in Appendix H.\n' +

      'We first find that all of the CKL methods except for T5-MixReview are more effective at forgetting less time-invariant knowledge while updating and acquiring new knowledge than using the naive approach of T5-Vanilla as shown by the FUAR. This result also highlights the main difference between CKL and CL; while rehearsal methods show strong performances in traditional CL settings (Prabhu et al., 2020; Bang et al., 2021), in CKL, it shows the worst performance since the update of outdated knowledge and acquisition of new knowledge is severely deterred as shown in the performance of UL and NL while not showing competitive mitigation of forgetting as shown in the performance of IL compared to other CKL methods. Amongst the other CKL methods, we observe a rather consistent trend that the parameter-expansion methods achieve better results. The first and second-best results on all of UL, NL, and NLE are all from parameter-expansion methods. Meanwhile, although UL and NL are constructed following the same procedure, there is a huge difference between the EM scores of UL and NL. We analyze the source of this difference in Appendix I.\n' +

In all of the tasks, the performance of T5-Initial can be considered as the upper-bound for IL and lower-bound for UL, NL, NLE. Corresponding with our main observations, CKL allows considerable retention of _time-invariant_ world knowledge while improving updating and gaining new world knowledge compared to T5-Vanilla, mitigating the overall trade-off.\n' +

We compare how CKL methods for T5 perform on IL, NLE\\({}_{\\text{P1}}\\), and NLE\\({}_{\\text{P2}}\\) when continually pretrained entirely on Small for 5k steps (8 epochs), and when sequentially pretrained on Small-P1 and then on Small-P2 for 2.5k steps (8 epochs) each. In the scenario Small-P1\\(\\rightarrow\\)Small-P2, there are two CKL phases where \\(D_{0}\\) is C4 and Wikipedia, \\(D_{1}\\) is Small-P1, and \\(D_{2}\\) is Small-P2.

      '\n' +
      'Comparing the performance on IL of the two scenarios, Small and Small-P1\\(\\rightarrow\\)Small-P2, results show that LMs are prone to more forgetting as they go through multiple CKL phases, despite having the same number of training steps. One of the reasons may be due to the learning rate scheduling, which is initialized at the start of each phase.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Furthermore, despite showing the best performance overall, the drawbacks of parameter-expansion methods are also highlighted in the Small-P1\\(\\rightarrow\\)Small-P2 setting; they require new parameters to be added at every phase of the update. For example, the number of total parameters of T5-Modular increases by 36M in every round of the continual pretraining phase. Likewise, considering a large number of CKL phases introduces new problems that should be additionally studied. Taking into account that LMs should be updated frequently with a small amount of data in real-world scenarios for gaining up-to-date world knowledge about the ever-changing world in a computation-effective manner, more research is needed to mitigate the amount of forgetting that follows the larger number of update phases.\n' +

      '**Effects of Epochs, Corpus Size, and Total Number of Training Steps in CKL on Forgetting** Figure 3 shows the result of T5-Vanilla and T5-Kadapters during continued pretraining in different scenarios from Table 2 and 3, where each point in the graph represents the performance of IL after every epoch. Comparing Main (4 epochs) and Small (8 epochs) in Figure 3 (a) T5-Vanilla, we can see that more forgetting occurs in Small, even though trained for five times less number of global training steps. This phenomenon is further highlighted when comparing results from Small-P1 (8 epochs) which shows the most amount of forgetting despite being trained for ten times less number of global training steps. While the overall drop is much mitigated in Figure 3 (b) T5-Kadapters, we observe the same trend between each scenario which goes to show how critical observing the same data repeatedly during continued pretraining is for causing forgetting.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The results are in line with findings from Lee et al. (2021) which suggest LMs should be pretrained with just a few epochs on less duplicating data for efficiency. We add additional intuition to their findings and conjecture that the inefficiency of pretraining from duplicate data could have been caused by the forgetting of the rather long-tail knowledge in the pretraining corpus.\n' +

      'In this paper, we propose Continual Knowledge Learning (CKL), where we establish benchmark datasets and metrics, and explore methodologies towards continual knowledge learning of an ever-changing LM. We find that parameter-expansion methods show the most robust performance throughout all of the experimental settings, which nevertheless has severe memory inefficiency and that seeing the same data often is a critical cause of forgetting. We also discuss several other interesting results of which we leave further exploration to future studies. To this end, we suggest the community to explore CKL for the better design of an ever-changing LM.\n' +

      'As mentioned in Section 2, there are fundamental differences between the traditional CL formulations and CKL which make the previous CL methods inadequate for the CKL setting. In this section, we introduce the prior traditional continual learning methods in detail, explore the methods from the literature set as baselines for the CKL benchmark and how they address the identified limitations of CL methods, and provide descriptions about alternative methods making LMs cope with the changing world.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Traditional Continual Learning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Traditional continual learning (CL) methods focus on addressing two aspects of transfer between sequentially incoming tasks: _forward transfer_ and _backward transfer_(Lopez-Paz and Ranzato, 2017). _Forward transfer_ refers to how past tasks affect the performance of the current and future tasks. _Backward transfer_ refers to how current or future tasks affect the performance of previous tasks. The general pretrain-finetune approach can be seen as an instance of _positive forward transfer_ where a model performs better on a target task after being pretrained on a more general source task. Moreover, catastrophic forgetting can be seen as an instance of _negative backward transfer_ where previous tasks suffer performance due to continued training on different tasks. With respect to these two aspects, CL approaches can be categorized into three main approaches: regularization, rehearsal, and parameter-expansion methods.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'RegularizationElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) is a method that regularizes important parameters of previous tasks while training for the current tasks, helping mitigate _the negative backward transfer_ of previous tasks. Important parameters are measured via a Fisher information matrix computed by measuring the magnitude of the gradient update step of each parameter during training of previous tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'RehearsalGradient Episodic Memory (GEM) (Lopez-Paz and Ranzato, 2017) is one of the first rehearsal methods that utilize samples from each task stored in _episodic memory_ and places an inequality constraint with respect to the losses of the samples in order to prevent _negative backward transfer_ as well as allow the _positive backward transfer_.

      'Parameter-expansionProgressive Neural Networks (PNN) (Rusu et al., 2016) is one of the earliest parameter-expansion/sharing approaches that introduce new sets of parameters for each new task where previous parameters are frozen and can be connected via lateral connections allowing for _positive forward transfer_. PNN not only prevents _negative backward transfer_ but also surpassed the previous pretrain-finetune approach in terms of _positive forward transfer_ in some tasks.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'As mentioned in Section 2, we explore the methods from the literature that have addressed the limitations of CL methods and thus are applicable to CKL. We also categorize these methods into the three main categories of CL.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'RegularizationMost CL methods that utilize regularization require computing important parameters of the previous task, which in this case is pretraining on the original text corpus. Determining these parameters is oftentimes unrealistic since it requires large-scale pretraining which can hardly be replicated by most. Also, exactly how and where the knowledge is stored in the parameters of an LM is currently extremely difficult to identify and localize (Vig et al., 2020; De Cao et al., 2021). RecAdam (Chen et al., 2020) overcomes this limitation by following the same training objective as EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) with a stronger independent assumption and places a quadratic penalty, riding the need to access the initial pretraining corpus.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'RehearsalLarge LMs are usually pretrained on a vast amount of raw text corpus such as Common Craww9. When treating pretraining as a CL task, limitations exist when trying to apply previous rehearsal methods since a few samples from the pretraining corpus cannot represent the overall world knowledge from the original pretraining corpus. Mix-Review (He et al., 2021) solves this issue by performing preliminary experiments in a smaller pretraining setting by assuming access to the pretraining corpus during finetuning and mixing random subsets of pretraining corpus depending on a mix-ratio that anneals towards the target task as training progresses. Mix-Review can be considered a mild version of multi-task learning.\n' +

      'Parameter-expansionK-Adapter (Wang et al., 2021) shares and freezes the original parameters and adds new parameters through adapters for continued pretraining of factual and linguistic knowledge and improve performance on three different knowledge-driven downstream tasks. More recently, LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) freezes the original parameters and injects trainable rank-decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters and the computational hardware requirement while performing on-par or better than training all of the parameters. Both methods hypothesize freezing the original parameters allows mitigation of catastrophic forgetting. We test out the hypothesis through implementation in our CKL benchmark.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Explicit MethodsFacts-as-Experts (Verga et al., 2021) store representations of entities in the form of key-value pairs into external memory that can be modified during inference time. RAG (Lewis et al., 2020) accesses a dense vector index of Wikipedia with a retriever and swaps indexes for updating the behavior of the model as the world changes. Blender Bot 2.0 (Xu et al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2021), is also one of the explicit methods that search the internet for recent knowledge and saves recent conversations in external long-term memory. Explicit methods, such as swapping indexes, adding explicit entity-relation knowledge, or searching the internet are in need of manual intervention during inference or are bound to tasks that require retrieval. In this paper, we focus only on implicit methods.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Implicit MethodsZhu et al. (2020) proposed a new task of explicitly modifying specific facts without forgetting unmodified facts and provided several benchmark approaches without utilizing non-parametric memory, including constrained layer-wise finetuning. Wang et al. (2021) proposed K-Adapter, a method that adds adapters to frozen layers of pretrained LMs to inject factual and linguistic knowledge and improve performance on downstream tasks. Chen et al. (2020) proposed a new optimizer that simulates the pretraining optimization while finetuning on the target task without needing access to the pretraining corpus, improving performance on the GLUE benchmark. De Cao et al. (2021) propose using a hyper-network to edit factual knowledge.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Even though these implicit methods are efficient methods of injecting or modifying knowledge from the implicit parameters of the LMs, they are all limited to injecting _specific knowledge_ such as the case of (Wang et al., 2021) or modifying _past knowledge_ such as the case of (Zhu et al., 2020; De Cao et al., 2021). No work, to the best of our knowledge, has specifically addressed the _catastrophic forgetting_ of world knowledge gained from the initial pretraining when continued pretraining on new text corpus for the gain of _new_ world knowledge.\n' +

In addition, three more experts11 who set up the data construction process and prepared the annotation guideline to ensure the quality of the data through post-validation and giving feedback to the annotators in real-time.

      'CC-RecentNewsWe first construct CC-RecentNews, a novel text corpus containing relatively _new_ knowledge as \\(D_{1}\\). We use news-please (Hamborg et al., 2017), similar to the CC-NEWS (Liu et al., 2019) and REALNEWS dataset (Zellers et al., 2019), to crawl 221,779 news articles published from May 2020 to April 2021. LMs initially pretrained on \\(D_{0}\\) constructed before May 2020 can be continually pretrained on CC-RecentNews to gain relatively _recent_ world knowledge.\n' +

      'InvariantLAMAWe create InvariantLAMA, a subset of the LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019) task for measuring _time-invariant_ knowledge which might be forgotten during CKL. Among the 41 relations of the T-REx (Elsahar et al., 2018) subset of LAMA, we manually select 28 relation types that probe for _time-invariant_ instances (a full list of _time-invariant_ relations are provided in Appendix B.1). We also remove instances where the answer overlapped with the subject following Poerner et al. (2019) since the answers for these instances can be inferred from the cloze statement itself. Lastly, we remove instances where the answer was a non-entity to leave only the instances that require world knowledge for prediction on their answers (Guu et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'UpdatedLAMA and NewLAMAWe construct UpdatedLAMA and NewLAMA for measuring the update of outdated knowledge and acquisition of new knowledge during CKL. The challenge of constructing UpdatedLAMA is that a knowledge instance can be only considered as the knowledge that requires update only if it is present in both \\(D_{0}\\) and \\(D_{1}\\) with changed details, and the challenge of constructing NewLAMA is that the knowledge can be considered new only if it is in \\(D_{1}\\) but not in \\(D_{0}\\). Therefore we set up the data construction process carefully. The pipeline for the creation of a single instance of UpdatedLAMA and NewLAMA, is shown in Figure 4 (a). Each potential instance starts off from a single article from CC-RecentNews and goes through the pipeline which will end up being (1) discarded (2) added to UpdatedLAMA or (3) added to NewLAMA in the end. The procedure is as follows:\n' +

(3) The crowd-source worker is instructed to convert the question into a cloze sentence so that it can be given as input to a pretrained T5 LM. The predictions of the T5 LM are stored along with the questions and cloze sentences. (4) The expert annotator ensures the quality of the questions and cloze sentences by cor\n' +

If the prediction is correct and the prediction is not the same with the _new answer_, the following instance must be present in both \\(D_{0}\\) and \\(D_{1}\\) with details changed, and thus is added to UpdatedLAMA along with the evidence document found in C4. If same, the instance is discarded because the instance is neither _updated_ nor _new_. (5) Lastly, if the model prediction is wrong, the expert annotator is asked to find an alternative answer for the question in C4. If not found, the instance is added to NewLAMA since the answer to the question could only be found in the article of CC-RecentNews (\\(D_{1}\\)), but not in C4 (\\(D_{0}\\)). Similarly, if the alternative answer is found in C4, we check whether it is the same as the _new answer_ and add the instance to UpdatedLAMA if not the same and disregard it otherwise.\n' +

The pipeline for the creation of a single instance of NewLAMA-Easy is shown in Figure 4 (b) and follows the following procedures:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '(1) First, the crowd-sourced worker is instructed to classify whether the given article contains _new_ information or not. (We define _new_ as not likely to be known before May 2020). If the article contains new information, the worker is instructed to select a sentence from the article that contains the most _recent_ information and an _entity_ among the possible answer candidates in the sentence and discard the article if otherwise. We provide the possible entities through a Named-Entity Recognition Model. (2) We make the selected sentence _stand-alone_ from the article through the decontextualization model provided by Choi et al. (2021). (3) The decontextualized sentence is paraphrased by a back-translation model (en\\(\\rightarrow\\)de\\(\\rightarrow\\)en) (Tiedemann and Thottingal, 2020) and checked whether the selected word is still in the paraphrased sentence; the sentence is discarded if not. (4) Next, we mask out the selected word from the sentence and ask two crowd-sourced workers to convert the cloze sentence into a question and answer the question.

We show the effects of learning rate variation regarding the trade-off between maintaining previous knowledge and acquiring new knowledge in Appendix E. We use learning rate warm-up for the first 10% of training and linearly decay the learning rate to half of the initial learning rate towards the end of training.

Applying T5-Kadapters consistently mitigates the trade-off between forgetting and acquiring new knowledge as shown by the improvement in FUAR from the T5-Vanilla model with the same learning rates, although the level of effectiveness varies according to the value of the learning rate. We do not perform extensive experiments with each of the varying learning rates since searching for the optimal learning rate for each different continued pretraining setting may be out-of-scope with this research.\n' +

Because each task requires a different training objective than the one used during pretraining, additional finetuning is necessary. We search for the hyperparameters such as training epochs, batch size, input size, output size, and learning rate of each individual KILT task to match the T5-base dev performance reported by Petroni et al. (2021). Using the identified configurations, we perform experiments on all of the KILT tasks with the continually pretrained models for each method as the initialization checkpoints.

      'Experimental ResultWe first focus on the performance on zero-shot Relation Extraction (zsRE), which is measured on the dev set of 12 relations that are ensured to have no overlap with the 84 relations of the train set (Levy et al., 2017). Since the setting is similar to the zero-shot probing setting of IL, the trend of the result on the two datasets are similar. The performance of T5-Vanilla drops to half from that of T5-Initial as shown in IL, and the best performing method for both datasets is T5-Modular. In addition, corresponding with results from the CKL benchmark, parameter-expansion methods generally show stronger performance than the other methods.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, for the other datasets that cannot be performed in a zero-shot manner, the intermediate process of continually pretraining on corpus \\(D_{1}\\) does not seem to be that harmful on the finetuning for the target tasks even though they are more related to the knowledge of \\(D_{0}\\). Even T5-Vanilla shows modest performance, sometimes with better results than some other CKL baselines. One hypothesis is that the models could have regained the original knowledge from corpus \\(D_{0}\\) through the finetuning process. Also, some of the knowledge could have been recovered through the test-train overlap (Lewis et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A more surprising finding is that the performance of some of the parameter-expansion methods are even higher than that of T5-Initial, which is considered to be the upper bound for KILT because T5-Initial is only trained on behalf of the knowledge from \\(D_{0}\\). For example, T5-Modular shows higher scores than T5-Initial on 6 out of 11 tasks. Since the parameter-expansion methods force the model to store the new knowledge in the newly added parameters during continual pretraining, one careful conjecture is these LMs have learned to combine and utilize in its internal representation of both old and new knowledge stored in separate parameters during finetuning to maximize the performance.\n' +

For continued pretraining, we use the common teacher-forcing pretraining objective. The initial learning rate for the continued pretraining stage is empirically chosen as 1e-4 (results with learning rate as 1e-3 are shown in Appendix G.1). After continued pretraining, we apply _light-tuning_, a process denoted for finetuning the model for only one epoch on a small portion of data similar to the evaluation set. Training on a single epoch constrains the model to barely adapt to the input-output form of the data and not to learn the knowledge in tuning samples, mitigating the problem suggested by Lewis et al. (2020).\n' +

      'To measure the time-invariant knowledge, we use InvariantLAMA (IL) because most of the slots to fill are at the end of the sentence. For light-tuning on behalf of IL, we use additional T-Rex data from Shin et al. (2020) which has a similar distribution as instances from IL. Among them, 5,000 instances with the same _time-invariant_ relations as IL are randomly sampled for _light-tuning_. On the other hand, unlike IL where most of the slots to fill are at the end of the sentences, the LAMA datasets for new knowledge in our CKL benchmark mostly have the slots at the beginning of the sentences. Therefore, we use the corresponding CBQA dataset of NewLAMA-Easy, NewQuestions-Easy (NQE) to roughly measure the new knowledge.15 For light-tuning on behalf of NQE, 5,000 instances are sampled from a set of QA pairs constructed from CC-RecentNews but not CC-RecentNews-Small to remove the test-train overlap.\n' +

      'Table 10 shows the CKL benchmark performance of GPT-2 models. We report the results averaged over 5 runs with different random seeds. As in Table 2, parameter-expansion methods show robust performance on both IL and NQE, resulting in low FUAR. This shows that these methods are not only effective on the encoder-decoder model but also the decoder-only model as well. One interesting result in Table 10 is that GPT2-MixReview performs the best on IL, with performance even higher than the initial model, which results in the best FUAR of 0 which means no forgetting occurred at all. We suppose that the training strategy of GPT2-MixReview, allowing access to samples of \\(D_{0}\\) during continued pretraining, would have allowed fast adaptation to knowledge from \\(D_{0}\\) during the _light-tuning_ phase. Performance of GPT2-MixReview suggests that it makes it possible to regain the original knowledge for decoder-only models even with small tuning steps.\n' +

      'We want to highlight that the discrepancy of the performances among the CKL methods between encoder-decoder LM (T5) and decoder-only LM (GPT-2) may not solely be on the LM architecture, but also on the learning rate and the evaluation method (light-tuning was used to evaluate GPT-2 while we evaluated T5 in a zero-shot manner).

By comparing the results in this table with those in Table 10, which is for models continually pretrained with a learning rate of 1e-4, the results in Table 11 shows worse performance on both IL and NQE. Unlike in Appendix E, increasing the learning rate does not result in better learning of new knowledge. Instead, NQE performance is even worse than GPT2-Initial for GPT2-Vanilla, GPT2-Recadam, and GPT2-MixReview. FUAR is _no gain_ for these cases by the definition of the metric because the denominator has the value of zero. This shows that a large learning rate for continual pretraining may lead to failure: neither retaining old knowledge nor acquiring new knowledge effectively. For parameter-expansion methods, because many parameters including the decoder are frozen during the continual training process, they seem to be less prone to the effect of a large learning rate.\n' +

In order to get rid of the influence of frequency of entities when analyzing the source of the EM gap, we find overlapping _Person_ type answers from UL and NL, and analyze only the 67 probing sentences for both datasets each paired to one of these entities. As shown in Figure (b)b, the EM on UL is still much higher than that of NL. Manually analyzing these instances, we find that the probing sentences for NL ask for relatively more _fine-grained_ knowledge compared to UL, since the instances of UL by definition are overlapped close sentences with different answers in the corpus \\(D_{0}\\) and \\(D_{1}\\), that naturally make them be _coarse-grained_. For instance, the probing sentences for entity "Tim Walz" in UL and NL are " \\(\\xrightarrow{\\ }\\) is the governor of Minnesota this year." and " \\(\\xrightarrow{\\ }\\) is the governor of Minnesota calling for the evacuation of St. Paul.", respectively. We thus conjecture that the main causation of the EM gap to be UL consisting of instances requiring _coarse-grained_ knowledge, which is likely to have appeared more during in \\(D_{1}\\), while NL consisting of instances requiring _fine-grained_ knowledge, which is expected to likely have appeared less in \\(D_{1}\\).\n' +
