      'We introduce **phi-3-mini**, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Miktral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., **phi-3-mini** achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. The innovation lies entirely in our dataset for training, a scaled-up version of the one used for **phi-2**, composed of heavily filtered web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide some initial parameter-scaling results with a 7B and 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called **phi-3-small** and **phi-3-medium**, both significantly more capable than **phi-3-mini** (e.g., respectively 75% and 78% on MMLU, and 8.7 and 8.9 on MT-bench).\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The striking progress of AI in the last few years can be largely attributed to major efforts throughout the world towards _scaling-up_ to ever-larger models and datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) have steadily increased in size from a mere billion parameters just five years ago (GPT-2 had 1.5 billion parameters [RWC\\({}^{+}\\)19]) to trillion parameters today. The impetus for this effort originates in the seemingly predictable improvement one obtains by training large models, the so-called _scaling laws_[KMH\\({}^{+}\\)20, HBM\\({}^{+}\\)22, MRB\\({}^{+}\\)23]. However these laws assume a "fixed" data source. This assumption is now significantly disrupted by the existence of frontier LLMs themselves, which allow us to interact with data in novel ways. In our previous works on the phi models [GZA\\({}^{+}\\)23, LBE\\({}^{+}\\)23, JBA\\({}^{+}\\)23] it was shown that a combination of LLM-based filtering of web data, and LLM-created synthetic data, enable performance in smaller language models that were typically seen only in much larger models. For example our previous model trained on this data recipe, **phi-2** (2.7B parameters), matched the performance of models 25 times larger trained on regular data. In this report we present a new model, **phi-3-mini** (3.8B parameters), trained for 3.3T tokens on larger and more advanced versions of the datasets used in **phi-2**. With its small size, **phi-3-mini** can easily be inferenced locally on a modern phone (see Figure 1), yet it achieves a quality that seems on-par with models such as Miktral 8x7B [JSR\\({}^{+}\\)24] and GPT-3.5.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The **phi-3-mini** model is a transformer decoder architecture [VSP\\({}^{+}\\)17], with default context length \\(4K\\). We also introduce a long context version via LongRope [DZZ\\({}^{+}\\)24] that extends the context length to \\(128K\\), called **phi-3-mini-128K**.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To best benefit the open source community, **phi-3-mini** is built upon a similar block structure as Llama-2 [TLI\\({}^{+}\\)23] and uses the same tokenizer with vocabulary size of 320641. This means that all packages developed for Llama-2 family of models can be directly adapted to **phi-3-mini**. The model uses 3072 hidden dimension, 32 heads and 32 layers. We trained using bfloat16 for a total of 3.3T tokens. The model is already chat-finetuned, and the chat template is as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: We remove BoS tokens and add some additional tokens for chat template.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The **phi-3-small** model (7B parameters) leverages the tiktoken tokenizer (for better multilingual tokenization) with a vocabulary size of 100352 and has default context length \\(8K\\). It follows the standard decoder architecture of a 7B model class, having 32 layers and a hidden size of 4096. To minimize KV cache footprint, the model also leverages a grouped-query attention, with 4 queries sharing 1 key. Moreover **phi-3-small** uses alternative layers of dense attention and a novel blocksparse attention to further optimize on KV cache savings while maintaining long context retrieval performance. An additional 10% multilingual data was also used for this model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Highly capable language model running locally on a cell-phone.Thanks to its small size, **phi-3-mini** can be quantized to 4-bits so that it only occupies \\(*\\) 1.8GB of memory. We tested the quantized model by deploying **phi-3-mini** on iPhone 14 with A16 Bionic chip running natively on-device and fully offline achieving more than 12 tokens per second.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Training Methodology.We follow the sequence of works initiated in "Textbooks Are All You Need" [GZA\\({}^{+}\\)23], which utilize high quality training data to improve the performance of small language models and deviate from the standard _scaling-laws_. In this work we show that such method allows to reach the level of highly capable models such as GPT-3.5 or Mistral with only 3.8B total parameters (while Mistral has 45B total parameters for example). Our training data of consists of heavily filtered web data (according to the "educational level") from various open internet sources, as well as synthetic LLM-generated data. Pre-training is performed in two disjoint and sequential phases; phase-1 comprises mostly of web sources aimed at teaching the model general knowledge and language understanding. Phase-2 merges even more heavily filtered webdata (a subset used in Phase-1) with some synthetic data that teach the model logical reasoning and various niche skills.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Data Optimal Regime.Unlike prior works that train language models in either "compute optimal regime" [HBM\\({}^{+}\\)22] or "over-train regime", we mainly focus on the quality of data for a _given scale_.2 We try to calibrate the training data to be closer to the "data optimal" regime for small models. In particular, we filter the web data to contain the correct level of "knowledge" and keep more web pages that could potentially improve the "reasoning ability" for the model. As an example, the result of a game in premier league in a particular day might be good training data for frontier models, but we need to remove such information to leave more model capacity for "reasoning" for the mini size models. We compare our approach with Llama-2 in Figure 2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 2: Just like for “compute optimal regime”, we use the term “optimal” in an aspirational sense for “data optimal regime”. We are not implying that we actually found the provably “optimal” data mixture for a given scale.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: 4-bit quantized **phi-3-mini** running natively on an iPhone with A16 Bionic chip, generating over 12 tokens per second.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2: Scaling law close to the “Data Optimal Regime” (from left to right: phi-1.5, phi-2, phi-3-mini, phi-3-small) versus Llama-2 family of models (7B, 13B, 34B, 70B) that were trained on the same fixed data. We plot the log of MMLU error versus the log of model size.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To test our data on larger size of models, we also trained **phi-3-medium**, a model with 14B parameters using the same tokenizer and architecture of **phi-3-mini**, and trained on the same data for slightly more epochs (4.8T tokens total as for **phi-3-small**). The model has 40 heads and 40 layers, with embedding dimension 5120. We observe that some benchmarks improve much less from 7B to 14B than they do from 3.8B to 7B, perhaps indicating that our data mixture needs further work to be in the "data optimal regime" for 14B parameters model. We are still actively investigating some of those benchmarks (including a regression on HumanEval), hence the numbers for **phi-3-medium** should be considered as a "preview".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Post-training.Our models went through post-training with both supervised instruction fine-tuning, and preference tuning with DPO. We have worked on generating and curating various instruction and preference data. This has improved the model chat capabilities, robustness, as well as its safety.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Academic benchmarks\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On the next page we report the results for **phi-3-mini** on standard open-source benchmarks measuring the model\'s reasoning ability (both common sense reasoning and logical reasoning). We compare to phi-2 [JBA\\({}^{+}\\)23], Mistral-7b-v0.1 [JSM\\({}^{+}\\)23], Mistral-8x7b [JSR\\({}^{+}\\)24], Gemma 7B [TMH\\({}^{+}\\)24], Llama-3-instruct-8b [AI23], and GPT-3.5. All the reported numbers are produced with the exact same pipeline to ensure that the numbers are comparable. These numbers might differ from other published numbers due to slightly different choices in the evaluation. As is now standard, we use few-shot prompts to evaluate the models, at temperature 0. The prompts and number of shots are part of a Microsoft internal tool to evaluate language models, and in particular we did no optimization to the pipeline for the **phi-3** models.3 The number of \\(k\\)-shot examples is listed per-benchmark. An example of a 2-shot prompt is described in Appendix A.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 3: For example, we found that using ## before the Question can lead to a noticeable improvement to **phi-3-mini**’s results across many benchmarks, but we did not do such changes in the prompts.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 4 Safety\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Phi-3-mini** was developed in accordance with Microsoft\'s responsible AI principles. The overall approach consisted of safety alignment in post-training, red-teaming, automated testing and evaluations across dozens of RAI harm categories. Helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets [BJN\\({}^{+}\\)22, JLD\\({}^{+}\\)23] with modifications inspired by [BSA\\({}^{+}\\)24] and multiple in-house generated datasets were leveraged to address the RAI harm categories in safety post-training. An independent red team at Microsoft iteratively examined **phi-3-mini** to further identify areas of improvement during the post-training process. Based on their feedback, we curated additional datasets tailored to address their insights, thereby refining the post-training dataset. This process resulted in significant decrease of harmful response rates,as shown in Figure 3.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Table 1 shows the results of in-house RAI benchmarks for **phi-3-mini-4k** and **phi-3-mini-128k** compared to phi-2 [JBA\\({}^{+}\\)23], Mistral-7b-v0.1 [JSM\\({}^{+}\\)23], Gemma 7b [TMH\\({}^{+}\\)24]. This benchmark utilized GPT-4 to simulate multi-turn conversations in five different categories and to evaluate the model responses. Ungroundedness between 0 (fully grounded) and 4 (not grounded) measures if the information in a response is based on a given prompt. In other categories, responses were evaluated in terms of the severity of harmfulness from 0 (no harm) to 7 (extreme harm) and the defect rates (DR-\\(x\\)) were computed as the percentage of samples with the severity score being greater than or equal to \\(x\\).\n' +

      '## 5 Weakness\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In terms of LLM capabilities, while **phi-3-mini** model achieves similar level of language understanding and reasoning ability as much larger models, it is still fundamentally limited by its size for certain tasks. The model simply does not have the capacity to store too much "factual knowledge", which can be seen for example with low performance on TriviaQA. However, we believe such weakness can be resolved by augmentation with a search engine. We show an example using the HuggingFace default Chat-UI with **phi-3-mini** in Figure 4. Another weakness related to model\'s capacity is that we mostly restricted the language to English. Exploring multilingual capabilities for Small Language Models is an important next step, with some initial promising results on **phi-3-small** by including more multilingual data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite our diligent RAI efforts, as with most LLMs, there remains challenges around factual inaccuracies (or hallucinations), reproduction or amplification of biases, inappropriate content generation, and safety issues. The use of carefully curated training data, and targeted post-training, and improvements from red-teaming insights significantly mitigates these issues across all dimensions. However, there is significant work ahead to fully address these challenges.\n' +
