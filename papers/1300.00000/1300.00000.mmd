###### Abstract

Electrical resistance measurements on different rod materials in liquid solutions, molten salts, or molten lead are considered to design a liquid level sensor in a sealed containers when the temperature of the fluid is very high (-1000\({}^{\circ}\)C) and conventional measurements are not possible due to properties of the fluid or condition of the container. An analytical solution to the problem is adopted to reduce the cost of the sensor and overcome the difficulties of calibration of sensors at high temperature for prediction of the level of liquid. An electrical circuit model is suggested for analytical solution to compute the resistivity versus height of the electrode rod submerged in the liquid in a narrow container. Good prediction of circuit model for experimental results is verified by comparison of analytical results of different combination of liquid solutions and rods' material with experimental graphs.

## Introduction

The requirement of measurment on liquid height level in a machine or instrument where direct visual measurement cannot be implemented is the motivation to design liquid level sensors (LLS)which are calibrated to show the height of the liquid in a container using variation in different physical, chemical, or mechanical properties or liquid response to an external source as a function of height of liquid in the container. Most practical method of LLS devices is to measure the response of the liquid to an external source of energy. The external energy can be chosen to produce sound in ultrasonic sensors or light in optical sensors or different electrical quantities such as capacitance resistance or inductance in electrical sensors.

Top source device ultrasonic sensors employ the reflection of the waves from the level of the liquid to determine the height of the liquid in the container. In case of bottom source sensors ultrasonic sensors, the time required to reach the waves to receiver through liquid is the factor to calibrate the sensor.

Principal of optical sensors is reflection of light from surface of the liquid or total internal reflection (TIR). In latter case, fiber optical fluid sensor is needed in which the optical fibers are embedded in easily cleaned surface for routine maintenance. Fresnel's equations are fundamental tools of measuring distance in fiber optic fluid level. The light source can be normal light, or for special application, laser or infrared light. In case of requirement of totally confined liquid container with small dimension at high temperature, both ultrasonic and TIR methods are not applicable. It is due to the size or structure of the sensor and uncertainty in controlling the information captured by the receiver.

Another option could be by means of measuring the pressure above the liquid using another liquid with different density. This requires contacting two liquids with each other, for which it is not possible in many cases because of harmful reaction between two liquids. Chemical activity of liquid or its components in service conditions, discards the applicability of sensors using pressure difference above some liquid in confined container.

Electrical sensors are sensors determining the level of the liquid using information collected in response of applied voltage to the liquid. They have the advantage of easy connection to control devices and software such as LabView. In most general and simple circuit, the measurable quantity is capacitance of a capacitor, resistance of a resistor, inductance due to electromagnetic field or impedance where a combination of all or two of previous quantity is measurable. However, they may be actuated based on the conductivity or resistivity. Electrical conductivity isa characteristic of all material that is the measure of how well the material accommodates the movement of electric charges. Resistivity, measured usually in Siemens, has inverse physical meaning of conductivity but like conductivity is temperature dependent. Most of the current liquid level sensors' technologies are not suitable to measure the level of all types of liquids at high temperature due to the liquid container size, required sensitivity and operation temperature of the liquid.

Focus of this paper is on seeking and suggesting a technology which can be used for LLS at very high temperature, up to 2000 Fahrenheit ( above 1000C) degree. Such LLS has many industrial applications, particularly in mobile, and compact nuclear power plant such as those used in navy, for which the chemical activity of the fluid prevents using pressure difference sensors. The target of the current experiment is to find a suitable and easy method to measure the level of hot liquid confined in a container with the width less than 0.625 inch. The objective fluid melts FLiNaK (0.465 LiF, 0.115 NaF, and 0.42 KF) which cannot be exposed to air and moisture, and therefore, the completion of confinement of the container is an essential requirement. Hence, FLiNaK fluid must be filled in a refractory metal sealed container for the industrial application, which narrows the possible options among described sensors to determine the height of the liquid in its container. Seeking for simple method and the cost effect in the problem as well as possible parasite sound wave signals in case of reflecting sound from the surface of the liquid for ultrasonic sensors and shallow container for optical sensors working with surface or internal reflection principal, make the electrical sensor easy, cheap, and practical. This paper introduces an electrical circuit model for analytical solution to compute the electrical resistance versus height of the electrode rod submerged in the liquid confined in a narrow container.

### Experiments' Description and Results

Numbers of experiment sets have been carried out with different combination of rods' material and solutions. Rods were mounted with specific distance apart from each other on top of a test-2 container and a voltage was maintained between them. Certain portion of liquid solution was added to the container at predefined elapsed time. Electrical resistance between two rods was measured using digital LCR. Figure 1 gives a general view of these experiments. The test-2 container was out of plastic with 500 ml scale. LCR device used in this experiment is HIOKI brand model 3511-50 LCR HiTE with high-speed measurement and high precision accuracy, as high as \(\pm\)0.08 percentage. The LCR meter was connected to the rods with 9140 four terminal probe. The LCR meter set up is listed in table 1. The distance between rods was kept constant along the rods via two or three spacers to keep the rods paralleling as well. Rods were fixed with respect to the container to avoid their movement during experiment and keep them straight in vertical direction. The LCR meter was connected to the rods with two terminal probes. This can be seen in Figure 2.

The position of probes on the rod was examined to be inefficient in the outcome of the experiment by connecting them at different height of the rods. A funnel attached to a plastic pipe, was used to pour a new portion of liquid into container to avoid wetting of the rods during test for precise measurement. To

### Experiment Set 3: Rods' Diameter

In these experiments set, the effect of the rods' diameter on the results is examined by the utilization of NaF solution electrolyte and pair Molybdenum rods as electrode with three different diameters. The rods were about 3 feet length with 0.050, 0.080 and 0.125 inches diameter. Recoding data was started at the next level of height: 0.1 inch for rods with 0.05 and 0.08, and 0.2 inch diameter for 0.125 inch diameter. The section in the graphs with slop adequately larger than zerois considered to find a one to one corresponding value between resistivity and height of the rods under liquid level. This section can be labeled as _calibration zoom_ of the graph. It can be concluded from Figure 7 that as the diameter of the rods decreases, the calibration zoom of the graph becomes wide significantly.

### Experiment Test 4: Rod Separation Distance

With the same experimental conditions as experimental set-3 but with different gap between the rods, Molybdenum rods with diameter 0.5 inch and 3 feet length has been tested to investigate whether the space between two rods affects the resistance measured between two rods. Figure 8 is the graphs for the results of the experiment with 0.25, 0.5 1 and 1.5 inches space between the rods for 120Hz frequency.

It can be observed that the resistance gets larger for higher rods' space. This can be explained by increasing the amount of the liquid between the rods in which the passing path for the current is increased in the liquid. This increment of the path has resistivity which is a function of resistant of amount of liquid between the rods. Furthermore, Figure 8 shows that the electrical resistivity elevation is minor and belongs only to calibration zone below 6 inch of the liquid level.

### Experiment Set 5: Rods' Material

Rods' resistivity plays a major role in the resistance measured between two rods. This experiments set conducts the effect of rods' material on electrical resistance between rods out of different materials submerged in the same liquid solution and compares them using the graph of their submerged rods' height versus resistance of the model.

Figure 7: Comparison of Resistance VERSUS HEIGHT OF Molybdenum ROS WITH DIFFERENT DIAMETER SUMMERGED IN THE NAF SOLUTIONFigure 9 presents the comparison between steel rods with diameter 0.14 inch and molybdenum with 0.125 inch both in fluoride sodium. Despite their insignificant difference in diameter, they behave similarly in F-Na liquid solution, and employ 50 mV voltages between rods. It might be of the cause that the conductivity of steel 310 is 1.3x 10\({}^{4}\) S and for the molybdenum one is 19x 10\({}^{4}\) S. The effect of the rod conductivity is more obvious if metal rods (which have much higher conductivity) is compared to semiconductors such as silicon carbide. Figure 10 demonstrates this comparison between SiC and steel rods in water, while Figure 11 is the comparison among 0.25-inch diameter SiC rods with 0.14-inch diameter steel and 0.125-inch diameter molybdenum rods in F-Na water solution. It can be found from the graphs in Figure 12 that the resistivity is high between less conductive SiC rods for all range of the liquid level compared to good conductive metal rods.

## Discussion

Thermal characteristic of materials at high temperature is not well enough known, therefore, all of these data have to be provided by extrapolation. Non-linear behavior of these characteristic make these extrapolations somewhat unreliable. Conductivity and resistivity of material are of the material characteristics, in which temperature dependent and consequently are affected by thermal characteristics behavior at high temperature. Conductivity of material has been established for many elements and engineering materials and it is well known that the conductivity of material decreases as temperature increases, or in some other material this reveals by increasing resistivity at higher temperature. Increasing in imperfection in the atomic lattice structure hampers electron movement. Moreover, thermal energy causes vibration of atoms about their equilibrium position and this interferes with electron movement. Therefore, having a model which can be used to ease the calibration of liquid level sensor reduces the difficulty of calibration of the sensor (e.g. safety issues, cost effect, required equipments, time, etc) at high temperature. Summarizing the results from experimental sets helps the establishment of an appropriate analytical model.

Following comments can be listed in the summary of experimental set results about the resistance measured between two rods subjected to DC voltage difference at room temperature,

Increasing the height of the rods under level of liquid decreases the resistance both in water and F-Na in water solution, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. It is due to higher conductivity of liquid in comparison to air which is practically an insulator. Hence, as larger portion of the gap between rods which are filled with liquid, the movement of electron from positive electrode to negative becomes easier. Here, the conventional sign is considered for the direction of electron movement.

Effect of liquid conductivity on the resistance is obvious in Figure 4.

The comparison of graphs in Figure 6 shows that only the gap between two rods affects the electrical resistance and the container space has insignificant effect on the measured resistance.

Rod's diameter has inverse relationship with resistance in calibration zone. Graphs for different molybdenum rods with different diameter in Figure 7 show that thicker rods have less resistance for the same experimental condition.

Space between rods has direct relationship with the resistance, which is confirmed by means of graphs in Figure 8.

For the same liquid, shape of the graph depends on conductivity of the rods. This fact is concluded from Figures 9, 10, and 11.

The effective of factors on the measured resistance in the aforementioned summary suggests that the resistance base technology in liquid level sensors can be modeled with an electrical circuit, which is described in the next section.

Then, the resistance of material for rods and liquid can be obtained by using the material resistivity as next,

\[R_{1}=\frac{\rho_{liquid}L_{liquid}}{A_{L}}\] (Eq-1)

\[R_{2}=R_{3}=\frac{\rho_{rad}(L_{rad}-y)}{A_{red}}\] (Eq-2)

Where \(y\) is the height of the rod submerged in the liquid. The resistivity of liquid is \(\rho_{liquid}\) and its value for our application is equal to the electrical conductivity of the FLiNaK. \(\rho_{rad}\) is the electrical resistivity of the rod used in the experiment. \(L_{liquid}\) is the length of resistance considered for R1 and it is equal to the resistance of liquid between two rods (h in Figure 12). The cross-section area of the rod is \(A_{rad}=\pi\)\(d_{rad}/A_{L}\) is the area in liquid between two rods which approximates the effective electrical resistance in the total resistance. In a two dimensional model, \(A_{L}\) is the

Reinvestigation of effect of space between rods and rods' diameter analytically using the suggested circuit model, leads to the same conclusion as what was claimed experimentally. This conclusion can be obtained by comparisons made in Figures 26 and 27. Figure 28 shows the linear response of silicon carbide rods of 0.25-inch diameter with h=1.0 inch in a molten lead solution based the analytical model of Eq-3. Consequently, the model can be used in general sense for any experiment, rods of different material, and liquid solutions to produce various types of liquid level sensor for different purpose and applications.

## Conclusions

Resistivity-based electrical sensor is an accurate and suitable choice in designing LLS at high temperature in closed loops or sealed containers especially when the fluid cannot be in contact with any other fluid or gas because of chemical reactivity, or when the conventional types of LLS fail to function due to circumstances of the container. Resistivity-based level sensor has simple design in which the fluid level is determined based on the measured resistance. An electrical circuit model has been suggested and verified for analytical computation. The experimental results have confirmed the validity of the analytical expression. Different factors affect the measured resistance and, therefore, these sensors need to be accurately calibrated. The experimental results and analytical outcomes approve the effect of these factors to be as following:

Space between the rods increases the measured resistance,

Rod's diameter has inverse relation with the resistance value,

Rod's electrical resistivity has direct relation with the recorded resistance,

Liquid's resistivity increases the electrical resistance of the sensor,

The liquid level is determined by height of rods submerged in the liquid. Resistance decrease with increasing liquid level,

Resistance versus liquid level graph depends on the differences between conductivity of rods compared to liquid. If the rods are categorized based on conductive, the graph is exponential and if it is labeled as insulator, the graph is linear.

This method to design liquid level sensors and the

suggested analytical model could be deployed for wide range of industrial applications at high temperature.
