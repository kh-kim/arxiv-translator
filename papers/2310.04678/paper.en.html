      '\n' +
      'In scientific research, the ability to effectively retrieve relevant documents based on complex, multifaceted queries is critical. Existing evaluation datasets for this task are limited, primarily due to the high cost and effort required to annotate resources that effectively represent complex queries. To address this, we propose a novel task, **S**cientific **DO**cument **R**etrieval using **M**ulti-level **A**spect-based qu**E**ries (DORIS-MAE), which is designed to handle the complex nature of user queries in scientific research. We developed a benchmark dataset within the field of computer science, consisting of 100 human-authored complex query cases. For each complex query, we assembled a collection of 100 relevant documents and produced annotated relevance scores for ranking them. Recognizing the significant labor of expert annotation, we also introduce Anno-GPT, a scalable framework for validating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on expert-level dataset annotation tasks. LLM annotation of the DORIS-MAE dataset resulted in a 500x reduction in cost, without compromising quality. Furthermore, due to the multi-tiered structure of these complex queries, the DORIS-MAE dataset can be extended to over 4,000 sub-query test cases without requiring additional annotation. We evaluated 17 recent retrieval methods on DORIS-MAE, observing notable performance drops compared to traditional datasets. This highlights the need for better approaches to handle complex, multifaceted queries in scientific research. Our dataset and codebase are available at [https://github.com/Real-Doris-Mae/Doris-Mae-Dataset](https://github.com/Real-Doris-Mae/Doris-Mae-Dataset).\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Scientists often have complex questions that require thorough exploration within various parts of their field (Figure 1). Finding relevant scientific literature, one of many challenges in this process, can be especially difficult when dealing with multi-faceted queries. These queries typically encompass numerous interconnected topics and require an information retrieval (IR) system capable of recognizing and responding to this level of complexity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Information retrieval, especially query-based document retrieval [78; 3; 34], is integral to many applications, from search engines [9; 13; 29] and content recommendations [58; 31; 41], to open-domain question answering (QA) [82; 33; 15]. A persistent challenge, however, is the low accuracy in processing complex and multi-intent user queries. Despite advanced search engines using semantic understanding and user behavior data in addition to keyword matching [13], these systems still fall short when dealing with complex, multi-intent queries. Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) models [63; 85; 75; 23; 66; 85; 47] are primarily trained on relatively simple queries [57; 17; 64; 61; 87]. Moreover, MacAvaney et al. [49] creates a variety of diagnostic probes, revealing NIR models\' instability when processing out-of-distribution textual inputs, potentially because they do not comprehend the deeper semantics of text. These limitations can lead to inadequate performance with more complex queries. While open-domain QA models like ChatGPT [11] have shown significant capability, they frequently produce incorrect or even fabricated responses [4; 46; 50; 39; 89], and are prohibitively expensive if directly applied to an entire corpus of scientific documents.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To address these challenges, we introduce a novel task, **S**cientific **D**ocument **R**etrieval for **M**ulti-level **A**spect-based qu**E**ries (DORIS-MAE). DORIS-MAE extends query-based and example-based IR paradigms [20; 44], aiming to give users more control in formulating queries using natural language. In order to advance research in this area, we present the DORIS-MAE dataset, comprising 100 unique complex queries in the computer science domain, paired with ranked pools of relevant CS article abstracts. Each query is organized into a hierarchical structure of aspects/sub-aspects, which aids annotation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A distinguishing feature of the DORIS-MAE dataset is its aspect-based hierarchical structure shown in Figure 1. This feature aids automation of the annotation process, expands the test case volume without additional annotation, and opens up exploration into the usefulness of aspect information for retrieval methods.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Furthermore, we introduce Anno-GPT, a pipeline for validating Large Language Model (LLM) annotations in a statistically sound manner. Our tests reveal that LLM annotations achieve quality comparable to those produced by human annotators, but with considerable savings in both time and cost. Additionally, the design of our pipeline lends itself to easy adaptation for different domains.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In our experiments, we evaluated 17 IR/NIR (Information Retrieval/Neural Information Retrieval) methods using the DORIS-MAE dataset. The methods have worse performance on DORIS-MAE compared to traditional document retrieval datasets, highlighting the complexity of DORIS-MAE, and the need for more sophisticated retrieval methods.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our main contributions are three-fold. First, by formulating the **DORIS-MAE** task we are shedding a new light on tackling complex, multi-faceted queries during scientific research. Second, we propose **Anno-GPT**, a procedure for rigorously evaluating the ability of LLMs to replace human experts for challenging annotation tasks. Third, we demonstrate the value of breaking complex queries down\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: Example from the DORIS-MAE dataset. Each query is broken down into aspects and sub-aspects. Aspects are semantically distinct components of the query, and sub-aspects are minimal requirements that can be extracted from the aspects.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'to an **Multi**-level **Aspect**-based hierarchical structure, for both annotation accuracy and potential improvements in retrieval methods.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 2 Related Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A range of methods have been developed for document retrieval and re-ranking. Classic retrieval methods like TF-IDF [67] and BM25 [72] utilize keyword matching between queries and documents, and fall short when the necessary key phrases are not known to users. To address this, researchers have applied deep learning techniques to develop NIR models, including RocketQA-v2 [63], ColBERT-v2 [66], SimLM [75], and SPLADE-v2 [23]. These models generate latent vector representations for queries and documents, which are effective for many retrieval tasks, but may not be able to handle textual inputs that are outside of their training distributions [49].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Other models such as SPECTER [18] and aspect-based ASPIRE [54] focus on calculating document-level similarity. These models are designed to retrieve given an existing paper as input, which makes them less suited for open-ended queries. Other retrieval models, such as text-embedding models (ada-002 by OpenAI [28] and E5-large-v2 [74]) and sentence-embedding model Sentence-BERT [62], all face similar limitations as NIR methods in that they struggle to simultaneously represent multiple aspects of a query. Despite these challenges, they tend to perform better on our dataset than specialized NIR models for efficient dense passage retrieval, indicating their potential for complex tasks like DORIS-MAE.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Large-scale traditional IR datasets [57; 86; 40; 66; 69] primarily contain simple, web-based queries. Models performing well on these datasets often struggle on DORIS-MAE. In contrast, more specialized IR datasets [56; 14; 53] require human expert annotation, and consequently are more limited in their scale. Mysore et al. [53] and Chan et al. [14] introduce the concept of "aspect" in document retrieval tasks. These datasets provide pre-defined categories for aspects such as "background" or "method". DORIS-MAE extends this work by allowing for open-ended aspects based on the context of the queries. In Narrative-Driven Recommendation (NDR) research [6; 2; 55], user queries are descriptions that capture a range of users\' needs. These queries are related to everyday tasks, such as finding restaurants and entertainment.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Progress in LLMs [11] and prompt-engineering [24; 45; 59; 79; 65] has made it feasible to leverage LLMs such as ChatGPT for annotating NLP tasks [90; 21], even outperforming crowd-workers in some cases [60; 70; 27]. However, these tasks do not necessitate domain-specific knowledge, and the annotations produced may not measure up to expert annotations. Faggioli et al. [22], MacAvaney and Soldaini [48] explored the notion of using LLMs to assist human in relevance judgements, and evaluated on TREC-DL datasets [19], which have single-faceted queries. Our work seeks to extend these efforts to new annotation tasks requiring domain expertise, while introducing a separate pipeline stage and a hypothesis testing stage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Dataset Description\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The DORIS-MAE task uses a dataset of 100 complex, human-written queries, each containing between 95 to 226 words. Each complex query is broken down into a hierarchy of aspects and sub-aspects, with aspects representing significant semantic components of the original query, typically a sentence or a few sentences. Sub-aspects further decompose an aspect into simpler, verifiable requirements. Both aspects and sub-aspects are generally one sentence long, though their semantic complexity varies. A complex query can have up to 9 aspects, and each aspect can further contain up to 6 sub-aspects. Figure 1 shows an example.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For each complex query \\(Q\\), we created a pool \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) of approximately 100 potentially relevant scientific abstracts to evaluate the re-ranking performance of various retrieval/reranking methods. Within the context of \\(Q\\) and its \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), the collection of aspects and sub-aspects is together denoted as (with slight abuse of notation) \\(Q:=\\{a_{i}\\}\\). For any aspect or sub-aspect \\(a_{i}\\in Q\\), and any paper abstract \\(p_{j}\\in\\mathcal{P}\\), they form a question pair \\((a_{i},p_{j})\\). We generated a total of 165,144 question pairs from the 100 queries, together denoted as \\(\\mathcal{D}:=\\{(a_{i},p_{j})\\}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To compute the relevance of a paper \\(p_{j}\\) for a query \\(Q\\), we first break the query down into its aspects. We then compute the relevance score \\(S(a_{i},p_{j})\\), which measures the relevance of paper \\(p_{j}\\) for aspect \\(a_{i}\\). The relevance score \\(S(p_{j}|Q)\\) for the query \\(Q\\) is the sum of its aspect relevance scores. An average score \\(\\frac{S(p_{j}|Q)}{|Q|}\\geq 1\\) indicates \\(p_{j}\\) is a relevant abstract for \\(Q\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[S(p_{j}|Q):=\\sum_{a_{i}\\in Q}S(a_{i},p_{j}) \\tag{1}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Thus, for each complex query and candidate pool, we provide a complete ranking for the list of abstracts. Additionally, we can choose a combination of aspects within a complex query \\(Q\\) and concatenate the corresponding sentences to form a sub-query \\(q\\subset Q\\), and can calculate the relevance score between a paper abstract \\(p_{j}\\) and a sub-query \\(q\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[S(p_{j}|q):=\\sum_{a_{i}\\in q}S(a_{i},p_{j}) \\tag{2}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Hence, for any sub-query \\(q\\subset Q\\) and the candidate pool \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) of \\(Q\\), we can also provide a complete ground-truth ranking order for \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). This allows the dataset to extend to over 4000 sub-query test cases at no additional annotation cost.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Candidate pool abstracts are taken from a database of 360,000 computer science papers between 2011-2021 sourced from arXiv3. We complemented each arXiv paper with its corresponding citation information by cross-matching it on Semantic Scholar [37].\n' +

      '### Query Formation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The DORIS-MAE task aims to mirror real-world scenarios where a researcher has an incomplete concept for a research project and needs to explore the breadth of existing research to establish a solid starting point. The 100 complex queries in our dataset simulate this scenario.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Each query is based on one or more existing research papers. We randomly selected 140 papers from AI, NLP, ML, and CV categories on arXiv. We examined each selected paper\'s motivation, background, related work, methodology, and experimental results. Using this information, we reverse-engineered a complex query designed to reflect the early thought process of the paper\'s authors. Overall, DORIS-MAE contains 80 queries derived from single paper abstracts, with 20 queries from each of AI, NLP, ML and CV. We created an additional 20 composite queries, each integrating ideas from 2-3 abstracts. These composite queries are designed to simulate more interdisciplinary and unexplored research ideas than the other 80 queries.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Decomposing Queries to Aspects\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we discuss our process of decomposing queries into a list of aspects and further breaking down aspects into sub-aspects. The guiding principles for determining aspects are as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Each aspect must correspond to a prominent and semantically meaningful component in the query (refer to Figure 1 for this correspondence).\n' +
      '2. Each aspect should contain sufficient context to make sense independently, eliminating potential ambiguities.\n' +
      '3. Each aspect must be semantically distinct and unrelated to others, ensuring their contents are disjoint and do not overlap.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Some aspects may fall into broader facets such as _background_, _method_, or _result_ as defined in [53]. Regarding decomposing aspects to sub-aspects, our criteria are:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Each sub-aspect should not contain more information than its parent aspect.\n' +
      '2. Each sub-aspect should represent a semantic segment of its parent aspect\n' +
      '3. Different sub-aspects may overlap semantically but each should pose a distinct question.\n' +
      '4. Each sub-aspect should be as simple as possible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Given the inherent difficulty in recalling the full details of a query while ranking a large candidate pool, the aspect-based hierarchical structure of our complex queries provides a systematic, efficient, and interpretable approach for annotation. This leads to a more precise ranking of the candidate pool. As each aspect corresponds to a specific part of the original query \\(Q\\), combining several aspects is equivalent to concatenating their corresponding parts in the query, forming semantically coherent sub-queries \\(q\\subset Q\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Candidate Pooling\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To create a candidate pool \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) of approximately 100 paper abstracts for each query \\(Q\\), we used a variety of IR and NIR methods, similar to the approach in [53]. More specifically, we utilized popular IR search algorithms TF-IDF [67] and BM25 [72] at different granularities (i.e., sentence and paragraph-level for each query) to retrieve around 80 paper abstracts. We then employed OpenAI\'s text embedding model, ada-002 [28], to extract 20 more paper abstracts. We also use citation signals from semantic scholar [37] to included any papers that directly cite or are cited by any of the original papers used to create that specific query. Lastly, to prevent bias towards lexicon-matching retrieval methods, we excluded from \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) any papers that authors referenced during query \\(Q\\)\'s formulation. See Appendix C.6 for a sensitivity analysis of our candidate pool construction procedure.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 4 Anno-GPT Framework\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We propose Anno-GPT, a framework for developing a statistically sound annotation pipeline. We use chatgpt-3.5-turbo-0301 to annotate all 165,144 question pairs \\(\\mathcal{D}:=\\{(a_{i},p_{j})\\}\\) where \\(a_{i}\\) is an aspect/sub-aspect of a query, and \\(p_{j}\\) is an abstract in the query\'s candidate pool. This strategy minimizes human annotation efforts. The key to this approach lies in breaking down complex queries into simpler aspects and sub-aspects, ensuring an objective and manageable annotation task. Without this structured approach, we found that evaluating an abstract\'s relevance to a complex query was challenging, due to variability in how partial relevance was assessed. However, the scenario changes significantly when dealing with question pairs \\((a_{i},p_{j})\\), which only look at a single aspect or sub-aspect of the query. In such cases, assigning a coarse-scale relevance score between 0-2 becomes feasible, maintaining a reasonable degree of objectivity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The performance of the annotation pipeline may be influenced by several factors: the procedure for breaking down queries into aspects, the criteria used for scoring query relevance, and the LLM prompt selection [24; 45; 59; 79; 65]. In order to avoid overfitting in this pipeline, our methodology comprises two distinct development and testing stages. The development stage involves optimizing all stages of the pipeline, and using feedback and observed outcomes to iteratively refine this strategy. The testing stage uses a prespecified hypothesis test. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the agreement levels of ChatGPT and humans, and those among humans themselves. After the pipeline has been optimized, we evaluate it on a test set. We compute the difference between ChatGPT-human agreement and human-human agreement. If this difference is sufficiently close to 0, with a small confidence interval, we can use the optimized prompt \\(\\pi\\) to annotate the full dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Below we give a summary of the Anno-GPT framework:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Construct aspect-document question pairs, \\(\\mathcal{D}:=\\{(a_{i},p_{j})\\}\\).\n' +
      '2. Select development set \\(S_{\\text{dev}}\\subset\\mathcal{D}\\), and use human annotators to score \\(S_{\\text{dev}}\\).\n' +
      '3. Select test set \\(S_{\\text{test}}\\subset\\mathcal{D}\\setminus S_{\\text{dev}}\\) based on desired power, and use human annotators to score \\(S_{\\text{test}}\\).\n' +
      '4. Optimize prompting strategy \\(\\pi\\) and other hyperparameters on \\(S_{\\text{dev}}\\). Fix \\(\\pi\\).\n' +
      '5. Evaluate fixed \\(\\pi\\) on \\(S_{\\text{test}}\\).\n' +
      '6. If satisfactory performance is achieved on \\(S_{\\text{test}}\\), proceed to use \\(\\pi\\) to annotate the entire dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\).\n' +
      '7. Otherwise, repeat steps iii, iv, v for \\(S_{\\text{dev}}\\gets S_{\\text{dev}}\\cup S_{\\text{test}}\\) and new \\(S_{\\text{test}}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is important to note that automated annotation for DORIS-MAE only used a single development/testing cycle, and therefore did not go into step vii. Therefore, there was no risk of inflated estimates of annotation accuracy due to multiple comparisons [30; 83; 1]. If multiple cycles are necessary, then the new \\(S_{\\text{test}}\\) must be sufficiently large to avoid these problems.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Annotation Guidelines\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our team of annotators consists of three graduate students in computer science, all with at least two years of research experience in NLP, CV, ML, and AI. Annotators, both human and ChatGPT, are asked to score each question pair using a 3-point grading scale (0-2):\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Level 0:** The abstract is unrelated or does not provide any help to the key components of the aspect or sub-aspect.\n' +
      '* **Level 1:** The abstract answers some (or all) key components (either explicitly or within one natural inferential step), but at least one key component is not answered explicitly.\n' +
      '* **Level 2:** The abstract directly answers all the key components of the aspect or sub-aspect.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We decided to include both direct and indirect coverage under Level 1, acknowledging that distinguishing between these cases could be challenging and potentially subjective. The detailed guidelines for human annotation can be found in Appendix B.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Optimization of Annotation Pipeline\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For the development stage, two annotators independently annotated a randomly selected set \\(S_{\\text{dev}}\\) of 90 question pairs from the complete set \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of 165,144 pairs. This annotated development set then served as the basis for refining the prompting strategies for ChatGPT.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The quality of annotations was evaluated using three metrics: macro F1 score, exact accuracy (agreement), and Spearman\'s rank correlation coefficient (Spearman\'s \\(\\rho\\)). These metrics measure the agreement level between annotators, and have been used successfully in similar tasks [53]. After satisfactory agreement levels were achieved between ChatGPT and human annotations on the development set, we transitioned to the hypothesis testing stage, with all three annotators involved. In this stage, we employed the fixed finalized prompting strategy, ensuring no overfitting or leakage from the test set.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our prompting strategy development involved experimenting with recent methodologies such as few-shot in-context learning (ICL) [16; 11; 80; 51; 91] and chain of thought (CoT) [38; 81; 77; 32]. We found that the CoT approach offered the most robust and optimal results for the task of annotating question pairs \\((a_{i},d_{j})\\in\\mathcal{D}\\). A comprehensive description of the prompt engineering process can be found in Appendix B.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Annotation Evaluations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Hypothesis testing was conducted using a sample of 250 question pairs \\(S_{\\text{test}}\\) from \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), distinct from the development set. The selected pairs were independently annotated by three human annotators. We used bootstrapping to estimate the 95% confidence intervals for the macro F1 score, accuracy (agreement), and Spearman\'s \\(\\rho\\). Though the sampling temperature is fixed at zero, recognizing small randomness introduced by GPU non-determinism [52], the ChatGPT annotations are run twice and the pairwise comparisons with human annotators are averaged across these runs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In addition to these prespecified analyses, we conducted post-hoc analyses using an adjudication procedure to create a more stable set of human annotations [53]. We use majority voting [8] between the three human annotators to decide the adjudicated annotation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The results presented in Table 1 show that the rate of ChatGPT-human agreement is within range of human-human agreement. Specifically, ChatGPT\'s performance is comparable to that of human annotators as measured by F1 and exact agreement (accuracy). The average agreement level for ChatGPT is numerically lower than average human agreement level as measured by Spearman\'s \\(\\rho\\). We note that the lowest Spearman\'s \\(\\rho\\) among two humans is \\(46.51\\%\\), which is comparable to the average ChatGPT/human\'s \\(\\rho=46.61\\%\\), suggesting ChatGPT\'s performance is still within the range of human-level agreement. All \\(p\\)-values are larger than the \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) criterion.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In a post-hoc analysis, we found that comparing ChatGPT to adjudicated human annotations numerically increased the rate of agreement. This provides qualitative evidence for ChatGPT\'s performance relative to that of human experts. We further analyzed instances where ChatGPT\'s annotations diverged from those of humans. Interestingly, the nature of these discrepancies was similar to those found between humans, with differences largely revolving around the interpretation of key components in aspect/sub-aspects. For example, ChatGPT occasionally differed from human annotators indetermining the importance of a given component. Detailed examples of ChatGPT\'s reasoning and a comprehensive error analysis can be found in Appendix B.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Scalability of Annotations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The hypothesis testing results support the use of ChatGPT for annotation. At deployment, the pipeline annotated all 165,144 aspect-paper pairs within a span of 24 hours, at a cost under $150. By contrast, human experts typically require approximately 4 minutes per question pair, resulting in an estimated 11,146 hours to annotate the entire dataset. The deployment resulted in a time reduction by a factor of 500, and a cost reduction by a factor of 1,000, without sacrificing annotation quality. Upon completion of the annotation process, we utilized Equations 1 and 2 to compile the results and compute the final rankings for both full-query and sub-query test cases. Anno-GPT could potentially utilize any high-performance LLM to replace ChatGPT and can be adapted for other expert-level tasks, given the availability of a small set of domain expert annotations for validation.\n' +

      '## 5 Retrieval Results\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This section presents the results of testing 17 models discussed in Section 2 on the DORIS-MAE dataset. When available, we trained the model on our CS corpus and denoted the best version as trained in domain (ID), see full training details in Appendix D.1. To contextualize their performance on DORIS-MAE, we compare the results with these models\' previously reported performances on various IR datasets, including MS MARCO [57], LoTTE [66], NQ [40], and Wiki-QA [86].\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### DORIS-MAE Benchmarking Results\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In our benchmarking process for DORIS-MAE, we use complex queries as inputs to these models. We employ a variety of metrics common in the IR/NIR literature for the evaluation, including R@5, R@20, R-Precision (RP), NDCG\\({}_{10\\%}^{\\text{exp}}\\), MRR@10, and MAP. For fairness, we adopted an alternative approach for models like RocketQA-v2 [63] and ColBERT-v2 [66] that were not designed to handle long queries. For these cases, we allow the models to process the input as either a single text string or sentence-by-sentence, and report the maximum performance achieved. Uniquely among the models that we consider, the ASPIRE models (TSApire/OTAspire) are designed to handle multi-aspect queries. For brevity, we only report the higher number among these two options for models in Table 2. For more detailed results, refer to Appendix C.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To better interpret the results, we compare against a random ranking baseline. In general, the models show consistent behavior, with larger and more general-purpose models (like E5-Large-V2, RocketQA-v2, ada-002, Specter-v2) faring better than the smaller and more specialized ones (like SciBERT [5], ColBERT-v2, BM25, TF-IDF).

      'The hierarchical structure of our dataset can be used to create additional, less complex tasks involving only parts of the query. For instance, by pulling out parts of the query corresponding to 2 Aspects, we are able to generate over 1000 test cases. For this task, we found a significant increase in the number of relevant abstracts. After re-evaluating all models for the sub-query DORIS-MAE, we observed model performance consistent with those seen in previous benchmarks, as indicated in Table 7. Comparing Table 7 with Table 2, we observed noticeably higher numbers for metrics such as RP, NDCG\\({}_{10\\%}^{\\text{exp}}\\), MRR and MAP, which are indicators of better model performances on this sub-query task. Since models remain unchanged, this suggest the sub-query task is less challenging than full-query task. This is intuitive since sub-queries are less complex and contain fewer aspects. Overall, the creation of these sub-query tasks underscores the adaptability of our dataset, which could accommodate a range of task complexities under the setting of DORIS-MAE.\n' +

      'To assess the utility of our dataset for training IR models, we conducted an experiment where we allocated 40 queries for training and the remaining 60 for testing. Using supervised contrastive learning (SCL), we optimized a margin-based triplet loss as presented in Equation 3. Each triplet, represented as \\((A,P,N)\\), consisted of a query and two abstracts. The higher-ranked abstract in the training data served as the positive instance (i.e., \\(P\\)), with the other functioning as the negative instance (i.e., \\(N\\)). Given each query\'s candidate pool size of \\(\\geq 100\\), we derived multiple triplets. This process yielded 3,000 triplets from the designated 40 training queries. Subsequently, we fine-tuned an E5-L-v2 model, a RoBERTa-based text embedding variant with 355 million parameters, over a single epoch.\n' +

      'When evaluating the model on the 60 test queries, we noted a marked improvement across all metrics with the SCL-trained model in contrast to the pre-trained baseline. This comparison can be found in Table 8. These positive outcomes, achieved using supervised contrastive learning on DORIS-MAE, underscore the utility of our train/test split for model fine-tuning.\n' +

      'The hierarchical structure of complex queries, as exemplified in DORIS-MAE, is an area that warrants further attention. Future work might include the development of more sophisticated automated query breakdown methods, potentially drawing from advances in question decomposition [36; 92], sequence-to-sequence modelling [42; 43] and semantic parsing [76; 88; 68].\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Limitations**: DORIS-MAE currently contains queries and abstracts from the computer science domain. Consequently, models trained on this dataset may not generalize well to other disciplines. An extended, multi-domain version of DORIS-MAE is a logical direction for future work. The task of determining aspect relevance is challenging due to the complexity of the abstracts. Improved annotation guidelines and training (for both humans and models) may address this challenge. Finally, while we harnessed LLMs to streamline the annotation, the generation of queries and their aspect decomposition remains manual. We found the development of a reliable, automated query generation pipeline difficult, but anticipate that advances in LLMs might bridge this gap in the near future.\n' +

We commit to regularly maintain the dataset and codebase by incorporating user feedback. We will potentially introduce more features as part of future work in the next version of DORIS-MAE. We confirm that the current version of DORIS-MAE would always remain accessible at the same link.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Dataset Overview\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The DORIS-MAE dataset is comprised of four main sub-datasets, each serving distinct purposes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The **Query** dataset contains 100 human-crafted complex queries spanning across five categories: ML, NLP, CV, AI, and Composite. Each category has 20 associated queries. Queries are broken down into aspects (ranging from 3 to 9 per query) and sub-aspects (from 0 to 6 per aspect, with 0 signifying no further breakdown required). For each query, a corresponding candidate pool of relevant paper abstracts, ranging from 99 to 138, is provided.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The **Corpus** dataset is composed of 363,133 abstracts from computer science papers, published between 2011-2021, and sourced from arXiv. Each entry includes title, original abstract, URL, primary and secondary categories, as well as citation information retrieved from Semantic Scholar. A masked version of each abstract is also provided, facilitating the automated creation of queries.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The **Annotation** dataset includes generated annotations for all 165,144 question pairs, each comprising an aspect/sub-aspect and a corresponding paper abstract from the query\'s candidate pool. It includes the original text generated by ChatGPT explaining its decision-making process, along with a three-level relevance score (e.g., 0,1,2) representing ChatGPT\'s final decision.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Finally, the **Test Set** dataset contains human annotations for a random selection of 250 question pairs used in hypothesis testing. It includes each of the three human annotators\' final decisions, recorded as a three-level relevance score (e.g., 0,1,2). Note, the development set contains 90 annotated question pairs. Since the annotations in the development set come from only 2 annotators and since the development set is strictly not a part of the hypothesis testing stage, we do not include the development set in the officially released DORIS-MAE dataset. Instead, we provide the development set as part of the codebase on [https://github.com/Real-Doris-Mae/Doris-Mae-Dataset/](https://github.com/Real-Doris-Mae/Doris-Mae-Dataset/).\n' +
      '\n' +

      '\n' +
      'To better interpret the results of our evaluations and guide future improvements, we provide several analyses of the distribution and relevance of the abstracts in our DORIS-MAE dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We used Equations 1 and 2 to determine the relevance of an abstract to a specific query. We then examined the distribution of the number of relevant abstracts for different queries and considered how this might impact various evaluation metrics.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Table 9 presents the distribution of relevant abstracts categorized by query type (ML, NLP, CV, AI, and Composite) in our dataset. For each category, we determined the count of relevant abstracts for\n' +
      '\n' +
      'its respective queries and provided summary statistics of these counts. We find that composite queries have a lower average number of relevant abstracts, implying that such queries might encompass aspects or sub-aspects not extensively covered by papers in their associated pools. This observation, along with the varied number of relevant abstracts per query (ranging from 0 to 84), suggests that the DORIS-MAE dataset encompasses queries of diverse difficulty levels. It\'s noteworthy that four queries lack any relevant abstracts and were consequently omitted from our evaluation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The lower portion of Table 9 presents the distribution of relevant abstracts for 1003 sub-queries with two aspects. As the table shows, the number of relevant abstracts increases across all five types, suggesting that the sub-query DORIS-MAE task is less challenging than the full-query DORIS-MAE task.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Next, we examined the distribution of normalized scores (defined as \\(\\frac{S(p_{j}|Q)}{|Q|}\\)) for each abstract given a query. We compiled the normalized scores for each abstract in the candidate pools for each query type and report the aggregate statistics in Table 10. Composite queries have the lowest average relevance scores.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2(a) shows the normalized scores within a candidate pool (ranked in descending order) for a given query. Figure 2(b) aggregates the data from Figure 2(a). As seen in Figure 2(a), there are only a few plateaus (i.e., abstracts with tied scores), which means the normalized scores provide a fine-grained ranking for the candidate pool. This granularity is valuable when evaluating reranking models.\n' +

      '### Annotation Guidelines\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In Section 4, we introduced the grading scale (0-2) for evaluating the relationship between an abstract and an aspect/sub-aspect in a question pair. To facilitate this annotation process, we expand the definition of Level 1 into two sub-categories, creating a four-level grading scale during the annotation phase. Afterward, these levels are mapped back onto the original three-level scale.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The four-level grading scale and their corresponding mappings are as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. **DISAGREE**: This corresponds to Level 0 in the main paper. The abstract is unrelated or does not provide any help to the key components of the aspect or sub-aspect.\n' +
      '2. **DISPUTE**: This is a sub-category of Level 1. The abstract answers some key components and is adaptable to fulfill the aspect/sub-aspect. However, the abstract does not directly address the aspect/sub-aspect.\n' +

      'During the annotation process, annotators must follow a set of guidelines designed to maintain consistency and minimize bias. These guidelines cover aspects like time management, communication among annotators (which is explicitly forbidden), use of additional resources, the process of question analysis, and the identification of key components. Details of these guidelines can be found in the following section.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. **Resource usage**: Given the technical nature of the abstracts, annotators may occasionally need to look up unfamiliar terms. They can use traditional search engines for these instances. However, they are strictly prohibited from using any large language model (LLM) interfaces or search engines powered by LLMs.\n' +
      '2. **Annotation process**: Annotators are required to read the entire abstract and question at least once before making a decision. They need to refresh their understanding of the four grading levels in their minds before finalizing their decision. On average, this process takes about 4 minutes, but no strict time limit is enforced. During the annotation process, annotators are strictly and explicitly prohibited from communicating in any way.\n' +
      '3. **Key component identification**: The grading scale revolves around the concept of "key components". It\'s up to the annotators, leveraging their research experience, to identify what constitutes as a key component in an aspect/sub-aspect. If there are multiple key components (e.g., 2 or 3), they are expected to monitor all of these components and verify whether the abstract mentions them.\n' +
      '4. **Inference rules**: Annotators can leverage their expert knowledge to draw reasonable inferences from the abstract\'s content with respect to the key components. However, they should avoid unnecessary complications in the correlation between the aspect and the abstract. Each inference made must have a clear, straightforward justification. The aim here is to ensure accuracy without over-complicating the annotation process.\n' +

      '#### b.2.1 Examples with relevance score 0\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Aspect/Sub-aspect_: The paper mentions the possibility that the labeling process introduces unwanted randomness or noise.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Abstract_: Recent approaches in literature have exploited the multi-modal information in documents (text, layout, image) to serve specific downstream document tasks. However, they are limited by their - (i) inability to learn cross-modal representations across text, layout and image dimensions for documents and (ii) inability to process multi-page documents. Pre-training techniques have been shown in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain to learn generic textual representations from large unlabelled datasets, applicable to various downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based framework that utilizes a combination of self-supervised and supervised pre-training tasks to learn a generic document representation applicable to various downstream document tasks. Specifically, we introduce Document Topic Modelling and Document Shuffle Prediction as novel pre-training tasks to learn rich image representations along with the text and layout representations for documents. We utilize the Longformer network architecture as the backbone to encode the multi-modal information from multi-page documents in an end-to-end fashion. We showcase the applicability of our pre-training framework on a variety of different real-world document tasks such as document classification, document information extraction, and document retrieval. We evaluate our framework on different standard document datasets and conduct exhaustive experiments to compare performance against various ablations of our framework and state-of-the-art baselines.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '_Abstract_: We develop methodology for estimation and inference using machine learning to enrich economic models. Our framework takes a standard economic model and recasts the parameters as fully flexible nonparametric functions, to capture the rich heterogeneity based on potentially high dimensional or complex observable characteristics. These "parameter functions" retain the interpretability, economic meaning, and discipline of classical parameters. Deep learning is particularly well-suited to structured modeling of heterogeneity in economics. We show how to design the network architecture to match the structure of the economic model, delivering novel methodology that moves deep learning beyond prediction. We prove convergence rates for the estimated parameter functions. These functions are the key inputs into the finite-dimensional parameter of inferential interest. We obtain inference based on a novel influence function calculation that covers any second-stage parameter and any machine-learning-enriched model that uses a smooth per-observation loss function. No additional derivations are required. The score can be taken directly to data, using automatic differentiation if needed. The researcher need only define the original model and define the parameter of interest. A key insight is that we need not write down the influence function in order to evaluate it on the data. Our framework gives new results for a host of contexts, covering such diverse examples as price elasticities, willingness-to-pay, and surplus measures in binary or multinomial choice models, effects of continuous treatment variables, fractional outcome models, count data, heterogeneous production functions, and more. We apply our methodology to a large scale advertising experiment for short-term loans. We show how economically meaningful estimates and inferences can be made that would be unavailable without our results.\n' +

      '_Abstract_: Decision-making is often dependent on uncertain data, e.g. data associated with confidence scores or probabilities. We present a comparison of different information presentations for uncertain data and, for the first time, measure their effects on human decision-making. We show that the use of Natural Language Generation (NLG) improves decision-making under uncertainty, compared to state-of-the-art graphical-based representation methods. In a task-based study with 442 adults, we found that presentations using NLG lead to 24% better decision-making on average than the graphical presentations, and to 44% better decision-making when NLG is combined with graphics. We also show that women achieve significantly better results when presented with NLG output (an 87% increase on average compared to graphical presentations).\n' +

Unlike most previous approaches such as concept-based methods or rule-based structured models, the proposed method uses image captioning model to construct sentential queries for visual information. In detail, our approach exploits multiple captions generated by visual features in each image with \'Densecap\'. Then, the similarities between captions of adjacent images are calculated, which is used to track semantically similar captions over multiple frames. Besides introducing this novel idea of \'tracking by captioning\', the proposed method is one of the first approaches that uses a language generation model learned by neural networks to construct semantic query describing the relations and properties of visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have created a new evaluation dataset, which contains about 348 segments of scenes in 20 movie-trailers. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we show that our method is effective for retrieval of video segments using natural language queries.\n' +

      '_Abstract_: Modern astronomical surveys are observing spectral data for millions of stars. These spectra contain chemical information that can be used to trace the Galaxy\'s formation and chemical enrichment history. However, extracting the information from spectra, and making precise and accurate chemical abundance measurements are challenging. Here, we present a data-driven method for isolating the chemical factors of variation in stellar spectra from those of other parameters (i.e. teff, logg, eh). This enables us to build a spectral projection for each star with these parameters removed. We do this with no ab initio knowledge of elemental abundances themselves, and hence bypass the uncertainties and systematics associated with modeling that rely on synthetic stellar spectra. To remove known non-chemical factors of variation, we develop and implement a neural network architecture that learns a disentangled spectral representation. We simulate our recovery of chemically identical stars using the disentangled spectra in a synthetic APOGEE-like dataset. We show that this recovery declines as a function of the signal to noise ratio, but that our neural network architecture outperforms simpler modeling choices. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven abundance-free chemical tagging.\n' +

      '_Abstract_: In survival analysis, regression models are used to understand the effects of explanatory variables (e.g., age, sex, weight, etc.) to the survival probability. However, for sensitive survival data such as medical data, there are serious concerns about the privacy of individuals in the data set when medical data is used to fit the regression models. The closest work addressing such privacy concerns is the work on Cox regression which linearly projects the original data to a lower dimensional space. However, the weakness of this approach is that there is no formal privacy guarantee for such projection. In this work, we aim to propose solutions for the regression problem in survival analysis with the protection of differential privacy which is a golden standard of privacy protection in data privacy research. To this end, we extend the Output Perturbation and Objective Perturbation approaches which are originally proposed to protect differential privacy for the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problems. In addition, we also propose a novel sampling approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to practically guarantee differential privacy with better accuracy. We show that our proposed approaches achieve good accuracy as compared to the non-private results while guaranteeing differential privacy for individuals in the private data set.\n' +

Recent convolutional neural network (CNN) based method has shown excellent performance by learning mapping relation using pairs of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) facial images. However, since the HR facial image reconstruction using CNN is conventionally aimed to increase the PSNR and SSIM metrics, the reconstructed HR image might not be realistic even with high scores. An adversarial framework is proposed in this study to reconstruct the HR facial image by simultaneously generating an HR image with and without blur. First, the spatial resolution of the LR facial image is increased by eight times using a five-layer CNN. Then, the encoder extracts the features of the up-scaled image. These features are finally sent to two branches (decoders) to generate an HR facial image with and without blur. In addition, local and global discriminators are combined to focus on the reconstruction of HR facial structures.

ICP used in this work, registers facial surfaces to a common model by minimizing distances between a probe model and a gallery model. However the performance of ICP relies heavily on the initial conditions. Hence, it is necessary to provide an initial registration, which will be improved iteratively and finally converge to the best alignment possible. Once the faces are registered, the occlusions are automatically extracted by thresholding the depth map values of the 3D image. After the occluded regions are detected, restoration is done by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The restored images, after the removal of occlusions, are then fed to the recognition system for classification purpose. Features are extracted from the reconstructed non-occluded face images in the form of face normals. The experimental results which were obtained on the occluded facial images from the Bosophorus 3D face database, illustrate that our occlusion compensation scheme has attained a recognition accuracy of 91.30\n' +

We propose "Active Neural Localizer", a fully differentiable neural network that learns to localize accurately and efficiently. The proposed model incorporates ideas of traditional filtering-based localization methods, by using a structured belief of the state with multiplicative interactions to propagate belief, and combines it with a policy model to localize accurately while minimizing the number of steps required for localization. Active Neural Localizer is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning. We use a variety of simulation environments for our experiments which include random 2D mazes, random mazes in the Doom game engine and a photo-realistic environment in the Unreal game engine. The results on the 2D environments show the effectiveness of the learned policy in an idealistic setting while results on the 3D environments demonstrate the model\'s capability of learning the policy and perceptual model jointly from raw-pixel based RGB observations.

      '\n' +
      'The dataset\'s hierarchical structure provides an opportunity to formulate simpler tasks involving only parts of a complex query. By extracting parts corresponding to two aspects, we generated over 1000 test cases, significantly increasing the number of relevant abstracts as outlined in Section A.5. The full results for this task are given in Table 15. As the length of these sub-queries is similar to a long sentence, we did not differentiate between embedding the entire query as a single vector or multiple vectors sentence-by-sentence. Except for OTAspire and TSAspire, we applied a single-vector embedding for all other models, including Sentence-BERT and ANCE.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We observed that ada-002 outperformed other models across all categories. All models exhibited slight increases in R-Precision, NDCG\\({}^{\\text{exp}}_{10\\%}\\), and MAP. These minor improvements correlate with similar increases in their random baselines, suggesting that they might be due to shifts in the random baseline rather than the models\' retrieval capabilities.Meanwhile, the small decreases in the random baselines of R@5 and R@20 indicate a drop in the retrieval models\' Recall@k performance on the sub-query level. This corresponds to an increase in the number of relevant abstracts per sub-query as shown in Table 9. As Recall@k is inversely related to the number of relevant abstracts per sub-query, and as the retrieval models do not appear to effectively retrieve relevant abstracts for these simpler sub-queries, it is unsurprising that their R@5 and R@20 metrics dropped substantially.\n' +

      'In this section, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the candidate pools in DORIS-MAE. The original candidate pools were primarily constructed using keyword-based methods. To evaluate how this may have influenced our results, we generated a second set of candidate pools for the first 50 queries in DORIS-MAE. These new "embedding-based candidate pools" were generated with two text-embedding models, E5-v2 and SPECTER-v2, which were not used during the original candidate pool creation.\n' +

      'For each query, we collect the top-ranking 150 abstracts that are not in the query\'s original candidate pool (75 from E5-v2 and 75 from SPECTER-v2). We applied the same LLM annotation procedure to estimate the relevance of each abstract in the candidate pool given the query.\n' +

      '**Relevance Analysis:** We first evaluated whether the new pool contains documents which are more relevant than those in the original pool.

      '**Reranking Performance Analysis:** Next, we compared the reranking performance of the IR models on the two pools. Comparing Table 16 with Table 2 and Table 14, we noticed significant performance decreases in E5-v2, SPECTER-v2, SimCSE and SentBERT on the new pool. The performance of ada-002 remains stable. Since all abstracts in the new extended candidate pool are considered highly relevant by the pretrained embeddings of E5-v2 and SPECTER-v2, which are the methods used for the extended candidate pool generation, the performance drops for these two models can be attributed to selection bias that makes it harder for the same reranking models to distinguish among their own pre-selected documents. Furthermore, transformer-based encoder models may be generating similar document representations, since most of these models also see performance drops. The results suggest that it is useful to generate candidate pools using methods that have low correlation with downstream reranking methods.\n' +

      'We retrained SPECTER and SciBERT on our corpus of 360k CS related papers with citation information. In particular, we retrained SPECTER for 4 epochs, but noticed decreasing performance beyond 1 epoch. Therefore, only the epoch 1 checkpoint is kept for SPECTERID. We leveraged the citation signals from Semantic Scholar [37] to train the SPECTER model. Abstract A is related to abstract B if A directly cites B or if A cites a paper that cites B. Our corpus consists of 282,121 abstracts with related abstracts by the above definition. Among these abstracts, each has an average of 76.327 related abstracts. Consequently, we utilize a total of 21,533,311 triplets during the training of SPECTER. We retrained SciBERT for 10 epochs using 8 GPUs in 12 hours. Checkpoint 10 is kept for SciBERTID.

      '\n' +
      'A: The dataset contains 50 queries in the fields of ML, CV, AI, and NLP. These queries are manually written. As described in Section 3.1, queries are formulated by first randomly sampling an abstract from the CS corpus, which contains 360k papers from 2011-2021 posted on arXiv, and designing queries based on these abstracts. Each candidate pool is selected from the CS corpus, which should represent close to the entirety of CS research papers during that time period.\n' +
