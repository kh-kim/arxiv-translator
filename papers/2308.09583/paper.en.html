      'Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present _WizardMath_, which enhances the mathematical reasoning abilities of Llama-2, by applying our proposed _Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback_ (**_RLEIF_**) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. _WizardMath_ surpasses all other open-source LLMs by a substantial margin. Furthermore, our model even outperforms ChatGPT-3.5, Claude Instant-1, PaLM-2 and Minerva on GSM8k, simultaneously surpasses Text-davinci-002, PaLM-1 and GPT-3 on MATH. More details and model weights are public at [https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM) 3 and [https://huggingface.co/WizardLM](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM).\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recently, Large-scale language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention and become the go-to approach for numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including open domain conversation [1; 2; 3; 4], coding [5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13] and math [14; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19]. A conspicuous example is ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI. This model uses extensive pre-training on large-scale internet data and further fine-tuning with specific instruction data and methods. As a result, it achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on various benchmarks. Subsequently, Anthropic, Google, and Meta also launched their competitive products one after another. Notably, Meta\'s series of Llama [4; 20] models have sparked an open-source revolution and quickly narrowed the gap with those closed-source LLMs. This trend also gradually stimulates the releases of MPT4, Falcon [21], StarCoder [12], Alpaca [22], Vicuna [23], and WizardLM [24], etc. However, these open models still struggles with the scenarios which require complex multi-step quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematical and science challenges [25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30; 31; 32; 33; 34; 35].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Chain-of-thought (CoT) [31] proposes to design better prompts to generate step-by-step solutions, which can lead to improved performance. Self-Consistency [34] also achieves remarkable performance on many reasoning benchmarks, which generates several possible answers from the model and selects the correct one based on majority vote [35]. In recent, [36] finds that process supervision with reinforcement learning significantly outperforms outcome supervision for solving challenging MATH problems.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Inspired by _Evol-Instruct_ and Process-supervised Reinforcement Learning, this work aims to enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of the SOTA open-source LLM, Llama-2 [20]. As shown in the Figure 1, we propose a new method named _Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback_ (_**RLEIF**_), which could firstly generate diverse math instructions data by math-specific _Evol-Instruct_, then we train an instruction reward model (IRM) and a process-supervised reward model (PRM) [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], the former indicates the quality of the evolved instruction and the later receives feedback for each step in the solution. The brand-new _Evol-Instruct_ method includes two downward evolution and upward evolution progress to produce the grade school math and challenging math respectively. Initially, we re-generate, filter and finetune the original math instruction data from GSM8k [42] and MATH [43]. Immediately, we train the Llama-2 models to obtain the reward models and our _WizardMath_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We perform experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k [42] and MATH [43], the results demonstrate that our _WizardMath_ outperforms all other open-source LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, _WizardMath_ observe a substantial improvement in pass@1 with an increase of +24.8 (81.6. vs. 56.8) on GSM8k, and +9.2 (22.7 vs. 13.5) on MATH. Notably, our model even also significantly surpasses OpenAI\'s ChatGPT-3.5 [5], Anthropic\'s Claude Instant-1 [39], and Google\'s PaLM-2 [44] in terms of pass@1 on GSM8k.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The main contributions of this work are as following:\n' +

      '* _WizardMath_ significantly outperforms various main closed-source LLMs, such as ChatGPT [5], GPT-3.5, Claude Instant [39], PaLM-2 [44], PaLM-1 [7] and Minerva[15] on GSM8k.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 2 Method\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we elaborate on the details of our _WizardMath_. Following WizardLM and PRMs[36], we propose _Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback_ (_**RLEIF**_)_, which integrates the _Evol-Instruct_ and reinforced process supervision method to evolve GSM8k and MATH, and fine-tune the pre-trained Llama-2 with the evolved data and reward models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in the Figure 1, our methods apply three steps:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Supervised fine-tuning.\n' +
      '2. Training instruction reward model, and process-supervised reward model.\n' +
      '3. Active Evol-Instruct, and PPO training.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Supervised fine-tuning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Following InstructGPT[2], we also firstly fine tune the base with supervised instruction-response pairs, which contains:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. To make the parsing of each step easier, we few-shot re-generate 15k answers for GSM8k and MATH with an Alpha version of WizardLM 70B model to produce solutions in a step-by-step format, then find out those with a correct answer, and use this data to finetune base Llama model.\n' +
      '2. To enhance the model\'s ability to adhere to the neural and diverse instructions, we also sample 1.5k open-domain conversations from WizardLM\'s training data, then merge it with above math corpus as the final SFT training data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _Evol-Instruct_ principles for math\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Motivated by the Evol-Instruct [24] method proposed by WiazrdLM and its effective application on WizardCoder [13], this work attempts to make math instructions with various complexities and diversity to enhance the pre-trained LLMs. Specifically, we adapt Evol-Instruct to a new paradigm including two evolution lines:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Downward evolution: It enhances instructions by making the questions easier. For example i): revising high difficulty questions to lower difficulty, or ii) producing a new and easier question with another different topic.\n' +
      '2. Upward evolution: Derived from original Evol-Instruct method, it deepens and generates new and harder questions by i) adding more constraints, ii) concretizing, iii) increasing reasoning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (_**RLEIF**_)_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Inspired by InstructGPT[2] and PRMs[36], we train two reward models to predict the quality of the instructions and the correctness of each step in the answer respectively:1. Instruction Reward Model (IRM): This model aims to judge the quality of the evolved instructions on three aspects: i) Definition, ii) Precision, and iii) Integrity. To produce the ranking list training data of IRM, for each instruction, we firstly use ChatGPT and Wizard-E 4 to generate 2-4 evolved instructions respectively. Then we leverage Wizard-E to rank the quality of those 4-8 instructions. Footnote 4: Wizard-E named Wizard-E-Generator, which is an Alpha version fine-tuned Llama model specifically used to execute _Evol-Instruct_ without APIs.\n' +
      '2. Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM): As there is no powerful open-source math reasoning LLMs before this work, there is no simple way to support highly precise process supervision without professional human-labelers and close-source ChatGPT. Therefore, we depend on ChatGPT to provide process supervision, and ask it to assess the correctness of each step in the solutions generated by our model.\n' +
      '3. PPO training. We evolve the original math (GSM8k + MATH) instructions by 8 turns, increasing the data size from 15k to 96k. We use IRM and PRM to generate the instruction reward (\\(r^{I}\\)) and the answer reward (\\(r^{A}\\)). Then apply a product as the final reward \\(r=r^{I}\\cdot r^{A}\\).\n' +

      'Large Language Models For Mathematical reasoning.It\'s well known that complex reasoning problems are challenging for NLP models, which include mathematical reasoning [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], common-sense reasoning [58, 59], and logical reasoning [31]. A substantial body of current research is centered around the intricate task reasoning of the Mathematical Word Problems(MWP) [30, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64], which requires the ability to understand mathematical concepts, computation and multi-step reasoning [16, 17, 18, 19, 36, 40, 46]. Addtitionly, models are evaluated across different levels of MWP benchmarks on some mathematical reasoning datasets such as AddSub [65], MultiArith [66], SingleEQ [67], SVAMP [60], GSM8K [42], AQuA [29] and MATH [43].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs, [31] proposed Chain-of-Thought Prompting, which attaches multiple reasoning steps before obtaining the answer for a question. By employing the simple few-shot reasoning strategy, LLMs are able to perform better in complex reasoning problems. Least-to-Most [68] prompting decomposes the problem into sub-problems that are then solved incrementally. Additionally each step has a more detailed reasoning process. Similarly, the Complex CoT [35] underscores the pivotal role of prompt complexity by strategically choosing the most intricate problems and their corresponding solutions to function as prompts. To alleviate the burden of manual efforts, [33] introduced Auto-CoT, an approach that automates the process of acquiring k samples through the application of clustering techniques on a provided dataset. With the objective of mitigating manual intervention, [32] proposed Zero-shot-CoT, which entails the straightforward practice of appending the phrase "Let\'s think step by step" to each answer, eliciting the inference steps without examples. Moreover, [34] expanded upon this notion by suggesting the exploration of diverse inference paths throughout the reasoning process. Consequently, the ultimate outcome is determined through either the aggregation of answers using majority voting or by leveraging a validation mechanism, as posited by [69]. [16] employs a straightforward approach for generating augmented samples, focusing on probing the correlation between LLMs and math reasoning ability.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Large Language Models For Reinforcement Learning.Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art models frequently manifest logical errors and a range of illusions [70, 71]. These anomalies become especially challenging within domains necessitating multi-step reasoning, where a singular logical misstep maybe precipitate the unraveling of an entire solution. An effective strategy involves the training of reward models aimed at discriminating between favorable and unfavorable outputs [36]. Early outcome-based approaches were mainly performed on algorithmic tasks [72, 73, 74, 75]. [42] demonstrated the significant benefits of reward models or validators, and [76] proposed a heuristic-based step-size-aware RM. [77, 78, 2, 79] proposed the use of reward models for a reinforcement learning pipeline. [20, 37, 38, 39, 42, 80, 81, 82] employed rejection sampling for searching to achieve alignment of LLMs with human preferences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The differences between outcome-based and process-based reward modelling are further discussed by [40]. Outcome-supervised reward models (ORMs) undergo training exclusively utilizing the ultimate outcomes derived from the model\'s chain-of-thought process. Conversely, process-supervised reward models (PRMs) are designed to solicit feedback for each individual step within the chain-of-thought progression. In the domain of logical reasoning, ORMs frequently employ incorrect reasoning pathways yet yield the correct final answer [83, 41]. Notably, PRMs has been demonstrated to effectively alleviate this phenomenon of inconsistent behavior [40]. [36, 84, 85] amassed an expansive corpus of process-based supervised signals through meticulous manual annotation, which verified that PRMs and supervision with manual annotation yielded more pronounced advantages for LLMs as compared to ORMs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Large Language Models For Instruction Fine-Tuning.The initial endeavors in instruction-following training work primarily focused on enhancing the language model\'s capacity for generalization across diverse tasks. This often involves the process of fine-tuning across substantially available Natural Language Processing datasets, and evaluates on the different NLP tasks. T5 [86] undertake the earliest attempts to train a range of NLP tasks, including Question and Answer, Document Summarization, and Sentiment Classification, by employing a consistent prompt format across all the data. Subsequently, instruction fine-tuning work such as FLAN [87], ExT5 [88], T0 [89], UnifiedQA [90], ZeroPrompt [91], and FLAN-T5 [92] emerged to adapt for a large number of downstream tasks. To address the challenge of misalignment between model outputs and human requirements, OpenAI manually annotates the instruction library to construct a diverse range of tasks. Simultaneously, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback technology is employed, which facilitate the rapid development of LLMs such as InstructGPT [2], ChatGPT\\({}^{\\ast}\\), GPT-4 [3]. To reduce manual involvement, self-instruct [93] improves instruction-following through self-generated instructions. Alpaca [22] used a dataset of 50k instructions generated from a limited (e.g., 175 samples) seed set of manually-written instructions. Vicuna [23] used 70k user-shared conversations with ChatGPT collected from ShareGPT.com. Meanwhile, WizardLM [24] introduces the evol-instruct approach, which seeks to refine the existing instruction data by enhancing both its complexity and diversity.\n' +

      '## 5 Conclusion and Future Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This paper introduces _WizardMath_, a mathematics model fine-tuned with _RLEIF_. The experimental results demonstrate that _WizardMath_ achieves SOTA performance surpassing all existing open-source LLMs on two widely recognized mathematical reasoning benchmarks: GSM8k and MATH. Furthermore, _WizardMath_ exhibits superior performance compared to some of the largest close-source LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, Claude Instant, PaLM-2, PaLM-1 and Minerva on the GSM8k benchmark.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Future Work.Although our _WizardMath_ achieves impressive mathematics performance, as depicted in Figure 2, our model still falls significantly behind the SOTA LLM, GPT-4 and Claude-2. Therefore, future work will prioritize the enhancement of the _RLEIF_ or better method to further augment the performance of our model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Broader Impact.Similar to the other LLMs, our _WizardMath_ could also generate unethical, harmful, or misleading information sometimes. Therefore, future research to address the ethical and societal implications is needed.\n' +
