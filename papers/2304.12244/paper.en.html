      'struction data generated by real human users, OpenAI\'s LLMs (e.g., InstructGPT [2] and ChatGPT 4) have achieved great success. These open-domain instructions can fully unleash the unlimited potential of LLMs [14, 15, 16, 17] and enable them to perform more complex and diverse tasks. However, using humans to create open-domain instruction datasets like OpenAI did will encounter the following challenges. The whole annotating process is extremely expensive and time-consuming [18, 19, 20, 21]. On the other hand, the difficulty level distribution of human-created instructions is skewed towards being easy or moderate, with fewer difficult ones (according to the difficulty statistics of ShareGPT [22] from Figure (a)a). Possible reasons for this are that the proportion of experts among annotators is low and creating complex instructions demands a lot of mental effort. Human annotators are prone to fatigue and cannot sustain high-intensity work to produce a sufficient proportion of high-difficulty instructions [23, 24, 25, 26]. Based on these issues, developing an automatic method that can mass-produce open-domain instructions (especially the more difficult ones) at a relatively low cost becomes the key to further advancing instruction-tuned language models [27, 28, 29, 30].\n' +

      'In this work, we introduce _Evol-Instruct_, a novel method using LLMs instead of humans to automatically mass-produce open-domain instructions of various difficulty levels, to improve the performance of LLMs. Figure 1 shows the running examples of _Evol-Instruct_. Starting from a simple initial instruction "1+1=7", our method randomly selects In-depth Evolving (blue direction line) or In-breadth Evolving (red direction line) to upgrade the simple instruction to a more complex one or create a new one (to increase diversity). The In-depth Evolving includes five types of operations: add constraints, deepening, concretizing, increase reasoning steps, and complicate input. The In-breadth Evolving is mutation, i.e., generating a completely new instruction based on the given instruction. These six\n' +

      'operations are implemented by prompting an LLM with specific prompts. Since the evolved instructions are generated from LLMs, sometimes the evolving will fail. We adopt an instruction eliminator to filter the failed instructions, which is called Elimination Evolving. We repeat this evolutionary process for several rounds to obtain enough instruction data containing various complexities.\n' +

      'We validate our _Evol-Instruct_ by fine-tuning open-source LLaMA [4] with our evolved instructions and evaluating its performance similar to existing SOTA works (e.g., Alpaca [31] and Vicuna [22]) on instruction finetuning. The instruction datasets we compare with are the data used by Alpaca (generated using self-instruct [32]) and the 70k ShareGPT (shared by real users) used by Vicuna. To prove that the instruction dataset from our method is superior to human-created instruction datasets, we select Alpaca\'s training data (generated from only 175 human-created seed instructions) as the initial dataset. We execute four epochs of evolution using OpenAI ChatGPT API5 and finally obtain 250k instructions. To ensure a fair comparison with Vicuna\'s 70k real user data, we sampled an equal amount from the full 250k data and trained the LLaMA 7B model. We name our model _WizardLM_. Due to the low proportion of difficult instructions in the previous instruction-following test dataset, we manually created a new difficulty-balanced test dataset, named _Evol-Instruct_ testset. We hire annotators and leverage GPT-4 to evaluate Alpaca, Vicuna, ChatGPT, and _WizardLM_ on _Evol-Instruct_ testset and Vicuna\'s testset. Our main findings are as follows:\n' +

      'Closed domain instruction fine-tuneEarly instruction-following training work [33; 10] concerns cross task generalization in LMs, where LMs are fine-tuned on a broad range of public NLP datasets and evaluated on a different set of NLP tasks. T5 [34] made the earliest attempt by training natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, document summarization, and sentiment classification together using a unified text-to-text format. Works such as FLAN [10], ExT5 [9], T0 [12], and KnowDA [35] increased the number of NLP tasks to around one hundred, with several instructions carefully designed for each task [36; 37; 38; 39]. Furthermore, works such as ZeroPrompt [11] and FLAN-T5 [13] raised the number of tasks to the thousands. These studies consistently show that fine-tuning LMs with diverse NLP task instructions enhances their performance on new tasks. However, LLMs trained with these closed-form instructions (i.e., instructions are often only for a single NLP task, and the input data form is simple) tend to fail in real-world user scenarios.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Open domain instruction fine-tuneOur work belongs to this research line. OpenAI has hired many annotators and written many instructions with corresponding correct responses. These human-created instructions have diverse forms and rich task types. Based on this dataset, OpenAI trained GPT-3 [1] into InstructGPT [2], which can process a variety of real user instructions and led to the success of ChatGPT. Since these outstanding works from OpenAI were not open-sourced, Alpaca [31] and Vicuna [22] subsequently actively explored open-domain instruction fine-tuning based on the open-source LLM LLaMA [4]. Alpaca used a dataset of 50k instructions generated from a limited (e.g., 175 samples) seed set of manually-written instructions. Vicuna used 70k user-shared conversations with ChatGPT collected from ShareGPT.com. Our work is different from InstructGPT and Vicuna in that we use AI-generated data for instruction fine-tuning. Unlike Alpaca\'s self-instruct [32] generation method, _Evol-Instruct_ can control the difficulty and complexity level of the generated instructions.\n' +

      'We start the evolution from a given initial instruction dataset \\(D^{(0)}=\\left(I_{k}^{(0)},R_{k}^{(0)}\\right)_{1\\leq k\\leq N}\\), where \\(I_{k}^{(0)}\\) is the \\(k\\)-th instruction in \\(D^{(0)}\\), \\(R_{k}^{(0)}\\) is the corresponding response for the \\(k\\)-th instruction, and \\(N\\) is the number of samples in \\(D^{(0)}\\). In each evolution, we upgrade all the \\(I^{(t)}\\) in \\(D^{(t)}\\) to \\(I^{(t+1)}\\) by applying a LLM instruction evolution prompt, and then use the LLM to generate corresponding responses \\(R^{t+1}\\) for the newly evolved \\(I^{t+1}\\). Thus, we obtain an evolved instruction dataset \\(D^{t+1}\\). By iteratively performing \\(M\\) evolutions, we can sequentially obtain \\(M\\) evolution datasets \\([D^{(1)}\\cdots D^{(M)}]\\). Our work focuses on open-domain instruction data, where instructions have varying inputs and tasks without a clear distinction between the instruction part and the input.\n' +

We initiate the instruction pool with the given initial instruction dataset \\(D^{(0)}\\). In each evolution epoch, upgraded instructions from the previous epoch are taken out from the pool.

To solve this problem, we designed a prompt to generate a completely new instruction based on the given instruction, requiring the new instruction to be more long-tailed. Our In-Breadth Evolving prompt is as follows:\n' +

      'I want you act as a Prompt Creator. Your goal is to draw inspiration from the @Given Prompt# to create a brand new prompt.

      '2. The evolved instruction makes it difficult for the LLM to generate a response. We found that when the generated response contains "sorry" and is relatively short in length (i.e., less than 80 words), it often indicates that the LLM struggles to respond to the evolved instruction. So we can use this rule to make a judgment.\n' +
      '3. The response generated by the LLM only contains punctuation and stop words.\n' +

We avoided using complex or multiple prompt templates from previous instruction tuning works[32, 40] to ensure the fine-tuned model can handle open-domain instructions.

For each instruction in each round of evolution, we randomly select one evolving prompt from total six prompts (i.e., five from in-depth evolving and one from in-breadth evolving) with equal probability. We execute above process using Azure OpenAI ChatGPT API7. Finally, we also leveraged the ChatGPT to generate responses. We use a temperature of 1 to generate response and set the maximum number of tokens for generation to \\(2048\\). Additionally, we set the frequency penalty to zero and top-p to 0.9.

We analyzed the data and identified 29 distinct skills that represent the main requirements of humanity, such as Coding Generation \\(\\&\\) Debugging, Math, Reasoning, Complex Formats, Writing, Extensive Disciplines, and so on. Figure 3a illustrates the distribution of the instances and skills in our test set. Our test set consists of 218 instances, each of which is an instruction for a specific skill. We compared our test set with Vicuna\'s test set, which is a benchmark dataset for evaluating instruction following models. We found that Vicuna\'s test set only 80 instances and 9 skills and is much smaller and less diverse than ours. Figure 3b shows how the difficulty and complexity of the test data vary across different instances. Our test data has a more uniform distribution, meaning that it contains instructions with different levels of difficulty and complexity. On the other hand, Vicuna and Alpaca have a skewed distribution, meaning that they mostly contain instructions with low difficulty and complexity. This indicates that these two corpus are not able to handle the evaluation on more complex and demanding scenarios.\n' +

Specifically, we recruit 10 well-educated annotators. To each annotator, four responses from Alpaca, Vicuna-7b, _WizardLM_ and ChatGPT are presented, which are randomly shuffled to hide their sources. The annotators then judge which response is better following criterion in Appendix H. Then they should rank the four responses from 1 to 5 (1 means best), and allowing equal scores for comparable instances.

This workout can improve athletic performance, increase endurance, and improve health. \\\\  & 3. Burst Training: Burst training involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. This workout can improve athletic performance, increase endurance, and improve health. \\\\  & In conclusion, HIIT is a form of exercise that has numerous benefits for athletes, including improving athletic performance, increasing endurance, and promoting overall health. However, it is important to properly plan and execute HIIT workouts to avoid injury and overtraining. Compared to other forms of aerobic exercise, HIIT is generally considered to be more effective for improving athletic performance and increasing endurance. \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n' +

HIIT has gained popularity among athletes in recent years due to its potential to improve performance, endurance, and overall health.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Benefits of HIIT for Athletes:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Increased Endurance: HIIT can help athletes build their endurance by improving their ability to perform at high levels for shorter bursts of time, which can transfer to longer, more intense workouts and competition.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. Improved Performance: By improving your anaerobic threshold--the point at which your body begins to noticeably fatigue--HIIT can help athletes push through the burn and perform at a higher level.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. Fast Results: Due to its high-intensity nature, HIIT can provide athletes with a significant training stimulus in a short amount of time, allowing them to see results faster than with traditional forms of exercise.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Risks of HIIT for Athletes:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Injury: High-impact HIIT workouts can increase the risk of injury due to the rapid, explosive movements required. Athletes should properly warm up and cool down before and after HIIT workouts to reduce their risk of injury.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. Heart Health: HIIT workouts can place a significant amount of stress on the heart, which can be dangerous for individuals with heart conditions or histories. Athletes should consult a doctor before starting any new workt regimen.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Comparison to Other Forms of Aerobic Exercise:\n' +
      '\n' +
      'HIIT differs from other forms of aerobic exercise, such as jogging, cycling, or swimming, in its high-intensity, short-burst nature. While traditional aerobic exercises have a continuous, steady state of intensity, HIIT uses brief periods of intense activity followed by rest, which can result in greater fatigue and thus improved performance.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Examples of HIIT Workouts:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Burpees: Burpees are a full-body workout that combines squats, a push-up, and a jump to produce a high number of calories burned in a short amount of time.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. Sprint Intervals: Sprint intervals involve short, all-out sprints followed by brief jogging or rest periods. This workout can improve speed and power.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. Battle Ropes: Battle ropes involve swinging a thick rope in a rhythmic motion, providing a full-body workout with high levels of intensity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Overall, HIIT can be a valuable addition to an athlete\'s training regimen due to its ability to improve endurance, performance, and provide fast results.

      '**Vicuna**: There are several ethical theories that differ in their approaches to moral decision making. Some of the most prominent ones are:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Virtue Ethics: This theory emphasizes the development of moral character and virtues, such as courage, honesty, and compassion. According to this theory, the best way to make ethical decisions is to follow a set of universal principles that align with these virtues. For example, if a company is considering a business decision that could harm the environment, a virtue ethics approach would be to consider whether the decision aligns with the value of protecting the environment. 2. Deontological Ethics: This theory is based on the idea that there are certain moral rules that apply in all situations and that morality is based on these rules. According to this theory, the best way to make ethical decisions is to follow these rules regardless of the consequences. For example, a doctor may choose to withhold life-saving treatment from a patient if the treatment is morally unacceptable.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'An example of how these ethical theories would apply to a specific ethical dilemma is the ethical use of artificial intelligence. Virtue ethics would suggest that the best way to ensure ethical AI use is to prioritize the development of moral virtues such as transparency, accountability, and fairness. Deontological ethics, on the other hand, would dictate that AI systems must be designed and used in a way that adheres to a set of pre-defined moral rules, regardless of the consequences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The strengths of virtue ethics are that it emphasizes the importance of personal moral responsibility and development, making it a more individualistic approach. The weakness of this theory is that it may be difficult to determine what virtues are truly universally important, and it does not provide concrete guidelines for decision making in specific situations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The strengths of deontological ethics are that it provides clear and concrete guidelines for decision making, making it a more structured and rule-based approach. The weakness of this theory is that it may not take into account the consequences of following these rules, and that it may be difficult to determine what moral rules are universally applicable.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'When evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different ethical theories, it\'s important to consider their underlying assumptions, their implications for decision-making, and their ability to address the specific ethical dilemmas of a given context. It\'s also important to consider the practicality of implementing the theory and the degree to which it aligns with our own personal values and beliefs.\n' +

      '2. Teleological ethical theories - which hold that the morality of an action depends on the outcome or result it produces.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. Virtue ethical theories - which hold that the morality of an action depends on the character or traits of the person performing the action.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Some examples of ethical theories are:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Deontological ethical theories: - Utilitarianism - which holds that the morality of an action depends on the outcome or result it produces. - Kantian ethics - which holds that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of the consequences or intentions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. Teleological ethical theories: - Utilitarianism - which holds that the morality of an action depends on the outcome or result it produces. - Consequentialism - which holds that the morality of an action depends on the consequences it produces.\n' +

      '3. Virtue ethical theories: - Aristotelian ethics - which holds that the morality of an action depends on the character or traits of the person performing the action. - Virtue ethics - which holds that the morality of an action depends on the character or traits of the person performing the action.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'An ethical dilemma is a situation where there are competing moral claims, and it is not clear which course of action is morally right. For example, a doctor may have to decide between saving the life of a pregnant woman or the fetus.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Deontological ethical theories would say that the doctor must prioritize the life of the mother, as it is inherently wrong to take the life of an innocent person. Teleological ethical theories would say that the doctor should prioritize the life of the fetus, as the outcome or result is more important than the intentions or actions of the doctor. Virtue ethical theories would say that the doctor should prioritize the life of the person with the strongest moral character, which in this case would be the mother.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The strengths and weaknesses of different ethical theories can be evaluated based on their ability to address the ethical dilemma at hand. For example, deontological ethical theories may be strong in providing clear guidelines for moral decision making, but may not take into account the potential consequences of the action. Teleological ethical theories may be strong in their focus on outcomes, but may not consider the intentions or character of the person performing the action. Virtue ethical theories may be strong in promoting moral character, but may not provide clear guidelines for moral decision making in complex situations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**ChatGPT** There are several main ethical theories that differ in their approaches to moral decision making, including consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. consequentialism holds that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. It emphasizes the importance of maximizing overall well-being or minimizing harm. Utilitarianism is a well-known consequentialist theory that holds that the moral action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure, and minimizes overall pain or suffering. Deontology, on the other hand, focuses on the inherent morality of an action, rather than its consequences. It emphasizes the importance of following rules or duties, regardless of the consequences. For example, the moral rule to not lie is considered inherently moral, regardless of whether it leads to a good or bad outcome. Virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of developing and embodying moral virtues or character traits, such as honesty, courage, and compassion. It emphasizes the idea that morality is not just about what we do, but also about who we are. To illustrate how these ethical theories might apply to a specific ethical dilemma, consider the following scenario: A doctor has only one dose of a life-saving medication, and there are two patients who need it urgently. Patient A is elderly and has multiple health problems, while patient B is a young child with no other health issues. A consequentialist might argue that the moral action is to give the medication to the patient who will benefit the most, in terms of maximizing overall well-being or minimizing overall harm. In this case, the young child would likely be given the medication, since they have a longer life expectancy and less potential for complications. A deontologist might argue that the moral action is to follow a moral rule or duty, regardless of the consequences. In this case, the moral rule to prioritize patients based on their medical need might apply, and the medication would be given to the patient who needs it most urgently, regardless of age. A virtue ethical might argue that the moral action is to embody certain virtues or character traits, such as compassion and empathy, and to consider the unique needs and circumstances of each patient. In this case, the doctor might take into account factors such as the patients\' age, overall health, and potential for recovery, and make a decision based on a holistic view of what is most compassionate and just. When evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different ethical theories, it is important to consider their theoretical coherence, practical applicability, and ability to account for the complexities of real-world moral dilemmas. Some ethical theories may be more well-suited to certain types of situations or contexts, while others may be more flexible or adaptable. Ultimately, the evaluation of ethical theories depends on a range of factors, including their ability to provide clear guidance, promote moral integrity, and promote overall human flourishing.\n' +

      '**Instruction:** Given that the hypotenouse of a right triangle is 13, and the ratio of the lengths of the two legs is 5:12, find the lengths of the two legs. \\\\ Solution: \\\\ \\hline Let the lengths of the two legs be 5x and 12x, respectively. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\(13^{2}=(5x)^{2}+(12x)^{2}\\) \\\\ \\(169=25x^{2}+144x^{2}\\) \\\\ \\(169=169x^{2}\\) \\\\ \\(x^{2}=1\\) \\\\ \\(x=1\\) or \\(x=-1\\) \\\\ \\hline\n' +
      '**WizardLM** & Since x cannot be negative, we can discard the solution x = -1. Therefore, the lengths of the two legs are \\(5x=5(1)=5\\) and \\(12x=12(1)=12\\). \\\\ \\hline\n' +
      '**Vicuna** & Therefore, the two legs of the right triangle are either both 5 units or both 12 units.

      '**Instruction: A bakery sells three types of cakes: chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. Each cake has a different price and a different number of calories. The chocolate cake costs S12 and has 400 calories, the vanilla cake costs S10 and has 300 calories, and the strawberry cake costs S8 and has 200 calories. A customer wants to buy two cakes with a total budget of S20 and a maximum of 600 calories. Which two cakes should the customer buy? Explain your reasoning.** \\\\ \\hline _WizardLM_ & To find the two cakes that meet the customer’s requirements, we need to calculate the total number of calories they want to consume and find the cakes that will add up to that number while staying within their budget. \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Let’s start by calculating the total number of calories the customer wants to consume: \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Chocolate cake: 400 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Vanilla cake: 300 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Strawberry cake: 200 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Total calories = 400 + 300 + 200 = 900 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Since the customer has a maximum of 600 calories, they can only buy one of the strawberry cakes. Now we need to find the second cake that will add up to the remaining 100 calories while staying within their budget. We can only use the chocolate or vanilla cake since they are the only ones that cost more than S8. \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & If we use the chocolate cake, we will have: \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Chocolate cake: 400 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Vanilla cake: 0 colories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Strawberry cake: 200 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Total calories = 400 + 0 + 200 = 600 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & If we use the vanilla cake, we will have: \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Vanilla cake: 300 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Chocolate cake: 400 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Strawberry cake: 200 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Total calories = 300 + 400 + 200 = 900 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Both options exceed the customer’s budget, so we need to find a third cake to use. Since the strawberry cake is the only one that costs less than S8, we can use it with either the chocolate or vanilla cake: \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Strawberry cake: 200 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Chocolate cake: 400 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & - Vanilla cake: 0 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Total calories = 200 + 400 + 0 = 600 calories \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & This option meets the customer’s requirements and stays within their budget. Therefore, the customer should buy one chocolate cake and one strawberry cake. \\\\ \\hline\n' +
      '**Vicuna** & To find the total number of calories in two cakes, we need to add the calories in each cake: 200 + 400 = 600 \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Since the customer has a budget of S20 and a maximum of 600 calories, the total cost of the two cakes should be less than or equal to S20. \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Substituting the calorie counts into this equation gives: \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\(200+400\\leq 20\\) \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Solving for the second cake gives: \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\(400\\leq 20-200\\) \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\(400\\leq 20\\) \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & 400/20 = 20 \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & So the minimum cost of the second cake is S20. \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & We can use this information to solve for the minimum cost and the maximum number of calories in the two cakes: \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Minimum cost = 20(20) + 300(8) = 520 + S240 = 5260 \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Maximum number of calories = 600 \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & The customer should buy a chocolate cake and a strawberry cake, as they cost a total of S260 and have a combined maximum number of calories of 600. These two cakes meet the customer’s budget of S20 and their calorie constraints. \\\\ \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & Therefore, the customer should buy a chocolate cake (with 400 calories) and a strawberry cake (with 200 calories), since they cost a total of S260 and have a combined maximum number of calories of 600. \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n' +
