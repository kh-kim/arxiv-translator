      'Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A major factor behind recent success of pretrained language models, such as BERT [30] and its variants [82; 22; 49] as well as GPT-3 [110] and its variants [111; 76; 9], has been the availability of well-designed benchmark suites for evaluating their effectiveness in natural language understanding (NLU). GLUE [133] and SuperGLUE [132] are representative examples of such suites and were designed to evaluate diverse aspects of NLU, including syntax, semantics and pragmatics. The research community has embraced GLUE and SuperGLUE, and has made rapid progress in developing better model architectures as well as learning algorithms for NLU.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The success of GLUE and SuperGLUE has sparked interest in building such a standardized benchmark suite for other languages, in order to better measure the progress in NLU in languages beyond English. Such efforts have been pursued along two directions. First, various groups in the world have independently created language-specific benchmark suites; a Chinese version of GLUE (CLUE [142]), a French version of GLUE (FLUE [72]), an Indonesian variant [137], an Indic version [57] and a Russian variant of SuperGLUE [125]. On the other hand, some have relied on both machine and human translation of existing benchmark suites for building multilingual version of the benchmark suites which were often created initially in English. These include for instance XGLUE [78] and XTREME [54]. Although the latter approach scales much better than the former does, the latter often fails to capture societal aspects of NLU and also introduces various artifacts arising from translation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To this end, we build a new benchmark suite for evaluating NLU in Korean which is the 13-th most used language in the world according to [34] but lacks a unified benchmark suite for NLU. Instead of starting from existing benchmark tasks or corpora, we build this benchmark suite from ground up by determining and collecting base corpora, identifying a set of benchmark tasks, designing appropriate annotation protocols and finally validating collected annotation. This allows us to preemptively address and avoid properties that may have undesirable consequences, such as copyright infringement, annotation artifacts, social biases and privacy violations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the rest of this section, we summarize a series of decisions and principles that went behind creating KLUE.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Summary\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In designing the Korean Language Understanding Evaluation (KLUE), we aim to make KLUE; 1) cover diverse tasks and corpora, 2) accessible to everyone without any restriction, 3) include accurate and unambiguous annotations, 4) mitigate AI ethical issues. KLUE is safe to use for both building and evaluating systems, because KLUE has proactively addressed potential _ethical_ issues. Here, we describe more in detail how these principles have guided creating KLUE from task selection, corpus selection, annotation protocols, determining evaluation metrics to baseline construction.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Design PrinciplesFirst, let us describe each design principle in detail:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* _Covering diverse tasks and corpora_: To cover diverse aspects of language understanding, we choose eight tasks that cover diverse domain, including news, encyclopedia, user review, smart home queries and task-oriented dialogue, and diverse style, both formal and colloquial.\n' +
      '* _Accessible to everyone without any restriction_: It is critical for a benchmark suite to be accessible by everyone for it to serve as a true guideline in evaluating and improving NLU systems. We thus use only corpora and resources that can be freely copied, redistributed, remixed and transformed for the purpose of benchmarking NLU systems.\n' +
      '* _Obtaining accurate and unambiguous annotations_: Ambiguity in benchmark tasks leads to ambiguity in evaluation, which often leads to the discrepancy between the quality of an NLU system measured by the benchmark and its true quality. In order to minimize such discrepancy, we carefully design annotation guidelines of all tasks and improve them over multiple iterations, to avoid accurate annotations.\n' +
      '* _Mitigating AI ethical issues_: It has been repeatedly observed that large-scale language models can and often do amplify social biases embedded in text used to train them [95]. In order to disincentivize such behaviors, we proactively remove examples, from both unlabeled and labeled corpora, that reflect social biases, contain toxic content and have personally identifiable information (PII), both manually and automatically. Social biases are defined as overgeneralized judgment on certain individuals or group based on social attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity, religion). Toxic contents include results, sexual harassment and offensive expressions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Diverse Task SelectionWe carefully choose the following eight NLU tasks with two goals; 1) to cover as diverse aspects of NLU in Korean, and 2) to minimize redundancy among the tasks. See Table 1 for their formats, evaluation granularity and other properties:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Topic Classification (TC): classify a single sentence into a single class.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Evaluation MetricsThe diversity of tasks in KLUE implies that we must choose a proper set of evaluation metrics for each task carefully and separately. Here, we list the tasks and describe how we choose the evaluation metrics for each of these tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* _KLUE-TC_ (Yonhap News Agency Topic Classification (YNAT)): We formulate KLUE-TC as a multi-class classification problem with seven classes. Because the headline alone is often not enough to precisely identify the proper class to which it belongs, we manually annotate and keep 70,000 headlines, for each of which there was a majority consensus on the class by the annotators. We then use the consensus classes as ground-truth classes and use macro F1 score as an evaluation metric.\n' +
      '* _KLUE-STS_: In KLUE-STS the similarity between each pair of sentences is annotated with the average (real-valued) similarity rating (between 0 and 5). We measure the quality of an NLU model in two different ways. First, we use the Pearson correlation coefficient between the real-valued target and prediction. Second, we compute the F1 score after binarizing the real-valued similarity rating as in paraphrase detection.\n' +
      '* _KLUE-NLI_: Similar to existing NLI datasets, such as SNLI [8] and MNLI [138], we use classification accuracy, and this is appropriate, as we create KLUE-NLI dev/test set to have a balanced class distribution.\n' +
      '* _KLUE-NER_: In KLUE-NER, a named entity recognizer is expected to output BIO tags and also categorize each detected entity into one of six types; person, location, organization, date, time and quantity. To account for rich morphology in Korean, we use entity-level and character-level F1 score to evaluate the quality of the detection to evaluate the recognizer\'s ability in determining the type of each entity.\n' +
      '* _KLUE-RE_: KLUE-RE is designed as a sentence classification task in which the input is a single sentence with two marked entities and the output is their relationship out of 30 types. We use two evaluation metrics. The first one is micro F1 score, considering only meaningful types (excluding no relationship), which allows us to evaluate the NLU system\'s ability to identify a fine-grained relationship between a pair of entities. The second one is the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), which gives us a holistic view into the quality of the relation extraction model in question.\n' +
      '* _KLUE-DP_: Following standard practice in dependency parsing, we use both unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and labeled attachment score (LAS) to evaluate a dependency parser. We annotate and use both formal and informal text\n' +
      '\n' +
      '(subsets from the news corpora and colloquial review corpora, respectively), which allows us to perform fine-grained analysis across multiple domains.\n' +
      '* _KLUE-MRC_: Similarly to KLUE-NER, KLUE-MRC is framed as a span prediction problem. We keep character-level exact match (EM) for comparison against existing datasets, while we propose to use ROUGE-W which measures the F1 score based on the longest common consecutive subsequence (LCCS) between the ground-truth and predicted answer spans. The latter handles rich morphology of Korean as well as the former does while being more interpretable.\n' +
      '* _KLUE-DST_ (Wizard of Seoul, WoS): We formulate KLUE-DST as a multiple-sentence slot-value prediction task, and evaluate an NLU system using two metrics. The first metric is the joint goal accuracy which measures whether all the slots were correctly predicted, while the other metric is average F1 score. Because the former treats all examples for which not all slots were correctly filled in, it often fails to distinguish similarly performing NLU systems. We address this shortcoming by reporting both the joint goal accuracy and slot F1 score. We furthermore build it using multiple domains in order to facilitate finer-grain analysis.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'BaselinesIn addition to creating a benchmark suite, we also build and publicly release a set of strong baselines based on large-scale pretrained language models. In due course, we pretrain and release large-scale language models for Korean ourselves, which will reduce the burden of retraining these large-scale models from individual researchers. We also use several existing multilingual pretrained language models and open-source Korean-specific models in addition to our own models, to gain further insights into the proposed KLUE benchmark. We present all the results in Table 32 and summarize a few interesting observations here. First, Korean-specific language models generally outperform multilingual models. Second, different models perform best on different tasks when controlled for their sizes; KLUE-BERT performs best for YNAT and WoS, KLUE-RoBERTa for KLUE-RE and KLUE-MRC, and KoELECTRABASE for KLUE-STS and KLUE-NLI. Third, as we increase the model size, KLUE-RoBERTaLARGE ends up outperforming all the other models in all the tasks other than KLUE-NER. Lastly, we observe that removing PII has minimal effect on the downstream task performances, and our tokenization scheme, morpheme-based subword tokenization, is effective in tasks involving tagging, detection and even generation at the morpheme level.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Task OverviewIn Table 1, we summarize the resulting eight KLUE tasks, listing important properties, such as type, format, evaluation metrics and annotated data sizes. In the rest of the paper, we will walk through the process by which each and every one of these tasks was constructed much more in detail.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Source Corpora\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We build KLUE from scratch, instead of putting together existing datasets, which has been a common practice in setting up benchmarks. We investigate available textual resources, and document the process in order to provide better understanding on how and why we select some corpora but not others. We adopt the recently proposed documentation frameworks; _datasheets_[41] and _data statements_[6]. Based on these frameworks, we document and provide more information to carefully describe our protocol.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Corpora Selection Criteria\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We consider two criteria when sourcing a set of corpora to build a source corpus from which task-specific corpora are derived and annotated. The first criterion is accessibility. As the main purpose of KLUE is to facilitate future NLP research and development, we ensure KLUE comes with data that can be used and shared as freely as possible to all. The second criterion is the quality and diversity. We ensure each example with these corpora is of certain quality by removing low-quality text and also the balance is met between formal and colloquial text within these corpora.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'AccessibilityUnlike Wang et al. [132], Hu et al. [54], Kakwani et al. [57], we design KLUE to reach as broad and diverse researchers as possible by avoiding any restriction on affiliations of users as well as the purpose of its use. Furthermore, we acknowledge the rapid pace of advances in the field and allow users to reproduce and redistribute KLUE to prolong its usability as a standard benchmark of NLU. To do so, we build and release the source corpus with CC BY-SA.4\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 4: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The source corpus, or a set of source corpora, satisfies the following conditions:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **No restriction on the use:** We allow both non-commercial and commercial use of KLUE, in order to accommodate the recent trend of fundamental research from industry labs.\n' +
      '* **Derivatives:** We allow users to freely refurbish any part of KLUE to first address any shortcomings, such as unanticipated artifacts, ethical issues and annotation mistakes, and second derive more challenging benchmarks for the future. This is similar to what has been done with SQuAD 2.0 [113] which was created to include SQuAD 1.1 [112].\n' +
      '* **Redistributable:** We allow KLUE benchmark datasets to be distributed by anyone via any channel as long as the proper attribution is given to the original creators of KLUE. We deliberately make this decision to avoid situations where only a limited and select group of researchers have a monopoly on resources, ultimately hindering the progress overall. This is in reaction to some of the existing Korean corpora which come together with restrictive policies, often preventing derivatives as well as redistribution, and are only accessible by researchers in Korea after acquiring permissions from the corpus publishers who are often public institutions in Korea. KLUE avoids such preventive policies in order to maximally facilitate the progress in Korean NLP.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Because most of the existing datasets do not meet these conditions, we curate the source corpus from scratch by considering only those resources that either come with one of the following licenses: CC0,5 CC BY,6 CC BY-SA,7 and other similar licenses such as KOGL Type 1,8 are not protected by the copyright act according to the latest copyright act in Korea,9 or have been explicitly provided to us by copyright holders under contracts. We end up 20 candidate corpora in total, of which subset is selected to form a source corpus set of KLUE. They are listed in Table 2.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Quality and DiversityAmong these 20 source corpora, we select a subset of ten corpora to form the source corpus and to build the KLUE benchmark. In doing so, we consider the following criteria; 1) the corpus should not be specific to narrow domains (diversity), 2) the corpus must be written in contemporary Korean (quality), 3) the corpus should not be dominated by contents that have privacy or toxicity concerns (quality) and 4) the corpus must be amenable to annotation for at least one of the eight benchmark tasks. Furthermore, we select the subset of corpora to cover both formal and colloquial uses.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The Final Source CorporaBased on these criteria and decisions, we choose News Headlines, Wikipedia, Wikinews, Policy News, The Korea Economics Daily News, and Acrofan News for (relatively) formal text.10 For more colloquial text, we use ParaKQC, Airbnb Reviews, and NAVER Sentiment Movie Corpus. These are marked bold in Table 2.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'In topic classification (TC), the goal is to train a classifier to predict the topic of a given text snippet. Topic classification datasets typically consist of news or Wikipedia articles and their predefined categories, because the categories often represent topics [151].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We include TC in our KLUE benchmark, as inferring the topic of a text is a key capability that should be possessed by a language understanding system. As a typical single sentence classification task, other NLU benchmarks such as CLUE [142] and IndicGLUE [57] also contain TNEWS and News Category Classification. For Korean, no dataset has been proposed for the task, which motivates us to construct the first Korean topic classification benchmark.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this task, given a news headline, a text classifier must predict a topic which is one of {politics, economy, society, culture, world, IT/science, sports}. We formulate TC as single sentence classification task following previous works and use macro-F1 score as an evaluation metric.\n' +

      '#### 3.1.1 Dataset Construction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our TC benchmark is constructed in three stages. First, we collect headlines and their corresponding categories, then we annotate the topics without looking at the categories and we finalize the dataset by defining its split into training, development and test splits considering the publication date and term appearances.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Source CorporaWe collect news headlines from online articles distributed by YNA, the largest news agency in Korea. Specifically, we collect the headlines of the published articles from January 2016 to December 2020 from Naver News.17 These articles belong to one of the following seven sections: politics, economy, society, culture, world, IT/science, and sports. To balance the data across the different sections, we randomly sample 10,000 articles from each section, except for the sports and IT/science section. We collect 9,000 sports articles and 11,000 IT/science articles.\n' +

Since the contents are protected as copyrighted work, we cannot freely use them without permission. Headlines, on the other hand, are not considered copyrighted work based on a legal precedent [23].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Annotation ProtocolThe headline of each article may not reflect all of the main content, such that the _topic_ of the headline may be different from the original news section of the article. To address this gap between the headline and the corresponding article, we manually annotate the topics of the headlines.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We use SelectStar,18 a crowdsourcing platform in Korea, to annotate topics of the headlines. For each headline, three annotators label topics independently from each other. Each annotator picks at most three topics in the order of relevance among the seven categories. For precise annotation, we also present _key terms_ of each topic to annotators. The terms are subsections of corresponding topics in NAVER news platform as shown in Table 3.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 18: [https://selectstar.ai/](https://selectstar.ai/)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'An annotator may choose _unable-to-decide_ if the headline does not contain sufficient information to identify the appropriate categories. Such an example is "Youngsoo Kim awards an appreciation plaque". There is no clue about who "Youngsoo Kim" is nor why he is awarding the appreciation plaque, in this headline.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We request the workers to report any headline that includes personally identifiable information (PII), expresses social bias, or is hate speech. We discard the reported headline after manually reviewing them.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Annotation ProcessWe run a pilot study to select workers, before commencing the main annotation process. We exclude workers who have continuously failed to assign a topic or have failed to agree with the other workers during the pilot stage. As a result, 13 workers have passed this stage of pilot study.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the main annotation, the 13 selected workers labeled topics for all 70,000 headlines. During the annotation, they reported 650 headlines are including potential PIIs (0.93%), 194 toxic contents (0.28%), and 2,515 _unable-to-decides_ (3.59%). We first exclude such invalid 2,953 headlines. The sum of the three type of problematic headlines are larger than the total value because of the intersection among them. After filtering them, 67,047 headlines remain.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We look at agreements between three annotators in valid headlines. We consider each of the first relevant topics chosen by three annotators. In 40,359 (60.5%) headlines, all three annotators agree to a single topic. 23,353 (34.8%) had two majority votes, and the other 3,155 (4.7%) did not reached to agreement. To make the headlines classified to a single topic, we remove the others, leaving 63,892 headlines.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We examine the second and third relevant topics within an annotator. For 48,885 (69.8%) of headlines, three annotators did not choose any second and third most relevant topic. Only 5,088 (7.3%) of headlines have the second topic in three annotators. We thus assume that headlines are sufficiently represented by the first relevant topics within an annotator.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We thus keep only a single topic for each headline, selected by at least two annotators out of three. The annotator agreement on the resulting 63,892 headlines is fairly high (Krippendorff\'s \\(\\alpha=0.713\\)) [67].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Final DatasetWe partition the final dataset, named YNAT (Yonhap News Agency dataset for Topic classification), into train, development, and test sets. We split the dataset based on the publication date. We include headlines published after 2020 in the development and test sets, while those published before 2020 in the training set. To prevent TC models attending specific keyword to classify the headlines, we also include headlines containing terms that have not appeared in the train set in the development and test set. As shown in the Table 3, train, development, and test sets consist of 45,678, 9,107, and 9,107 examples, respectively.\n' +

      '#### 3.1.4 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We introduce YNAT, the first Korean topic classification benchmark. The benchmark includes 63,892 news headlines classified to a single hand-labeled topic among 7 categories. We assume each headline has only a single topic, but it could be formulated as multi-label classification. We thus open the second and third relevant topic annotations. Also, URLs for each headlines are accompanied for future work if metadata is needed. If some of them requires permission to use, one should contact to the agency. We expect YNAT to serve as a simple and basic NLU task compared to others in KLUE.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Semantic textual similarity (STS) is to measure the degree of semantic equivalence between two sentences. We include STS in our benchmark because it is essential to other NLP tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and question answering. Like STS [13] in GLUE [133], many NLU benchmarks include comparing semantic similarity of text snippets such as semantic similarity [142], paraphrase detection [133, 57], or word sense disambiguation [125, 72].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We formulate STS as a sentence pair regression task which predicts the semantic similarity of two input sentences as a real value from 0 (no meaning overlap) to 5 (meaning equivalence). A model performance is measured by Pearson\'s correlation coefficient following the evaluation scheme of STS-b [13]. We additionally binarize the real numbers into two classes with a threshold score 3.0 (paraphrased or not), and use F1 score to evaluate the model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 3.2.1 Dataset Construction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Source CorporaTo diversify domain and style of source corpora, we collect sentences from AIRBNB (colloquial review), POLICY (formal news), and PARAKQC [18] (smart home utterances). We carefully match them to sentence pairs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For each corpus, we design a sampling strategy of sentence pairs to uniformly cover all range of the similarity scores. Without a sophisticated strategy, simple random sampling and matching sentence to pairs would result in a majority of the score zero. To alleviate this skewness, _potentially_ similar and less similar sentences are separately paired by using various methods. For instance, if two descriptions are depicting the same image or headlines referring to the same event, they are likely to be similar because of the additional information. Otherwise, they would not be similar [2]. Inspired from these, we use available additional information to pair sentences as similar or not. If not available, we use round-trip translation (RTT) to obtain the similar pairs and _greedy sentence matching_ for the less similar pairs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We specify the strategy for PARAKQC where the intent of each sentence is available. All sentences are queries for a smart home domain and their intent are shared among some queries. For example, "_How\'s the weather today in Seoul?_" and "_You know what the weather is like in Seoul today?_" share the same intent which is asking "The weather of Seoul today". We pair two sentences with the same intent as similar pairs and different intent as the less similar. Note that even the less similar pairs share topic to avoid making too many mutually dissimilar pairs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For AIRBNB and POLICY, we cannot find meaningful metadata to estimate similarity between sentences. So we adopt RTT technique using NAVER Papago20 to generate the similar sentence pairs, since RTT is known to yield sentences with slightly different lexical representation while preserving the core meaning of the original sentence. We set English as an intermediate language. We choose a honorific option when translating back to Korean because the option tends to preserve the meaning of the sentences empirically. For less similar pairs, we first compute ROUGE [80] of all possible sentence pairs, by assuming the higher score correlates with higher semantic similarity.21 Then we draw a pair with the largest score from all possible pairs and the draw is repeated over remaining pairs until all of sentences are matched. As it progresses, the score declines as the number of remaining pairs becomes smaller, producing less similar pairs. We summarize this process as _greedy sentence matching_ (GSM), as presented in Algorithm 1.\n' +

      '**Annotation Protocol** We modify the original annotation guide used in SemEval-2015 [2]. It suggests chunking both sentences and compares similarity in chunk-level (e.g., NP, verb chain, PP, etc.). Then an annotator should sum up their judgement to sentence-level similarity. However, we could not directly apply the guide because chunking is highly challenging in Korean. In chunking, tokenization and morpheme-level decomposition of words are required, but they are difficult and even not deterministic in some cases [103]. We thus guide an annotator to evaluate the similarity without chunking and stick to sentence-level comparison.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We give crowdworkers additional cues what is _important_ or _unimportant_ for sentence-level similarity evaluation. _Important_ content indicates the main idea in a sentence. If it is a declarative sentence, its providing facts, explanation, or information is the main idea. For an interrogative and imperative sentence, conveying a request or command is important. In exclamatory sentence, feelings or opinion is the main content [4]. Other components than these _important_ contents are regarded as _unimportant_. For example, they are auxiliary verbs or function words which affect its nuance or politeness. An annotator should score the similarity as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* 5: Two sentences are equivalent in terms of _important_ and _unimportant_ content.\n' +
      '* 4: Two sentences are closely equivalent. Some _unimportant_ content differ.\n' +
      '* 3: Two sentences are roughly equivalent. _Important_ content are similar to each other, but difference between _unimportant_ content is not ignorable.\n' +
      '* 2: Two sentences are not equivalent. _Important_ content are not similar to each other, only sharing some _unimportant_ contents.\n' +
      '* 1: Two sentences are not equivalent. _Important_ and _unimportant_ content are not similar to each other. Two sentences only share their topics.\n' +
      '* 0: Two sentences are not equivalent. They are not sharing any _important_ and _unimportant_ contents and even topics.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We also guide crowdworkers to consider the context of sentences. If it significantly affects distinguishing the meaning of two sentences, the score should be low. For example, let two sentences contain important information \'check-in\' such as "Check-in was done by someone other than the host." and "Check-in was done by someone." In the latter sentence,\'someone\' might be the host. Since we lose information by dropping \'other than the host\' from the former, difference of meaning between the two sentence is not ignorable. We score this pair to 3. Furthermore, if the former sentence is compared to \'Check-out was done by someone other than the host.\', _important_ information differ so we give score 2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Annotation ProcessWe recruit workers from SelectStar,22 a crowdsourcing platform in Korea and familiarize them to our annotation protocol. We run pilot annotation to select qualified workers. If a crowdworker\'s judgement is frequently disagreed against that of other workers, the person is excluded from the main annotation process. As a result, 19 out of the initial 20 workers participate in the main annotation. After removing the sentence pairs used in the pilot, we use 14,869 pairs for the main annotation, consisting of 7,375 for AIRBNB, 2,956 for POLICY, and 4,538 for PARAKQC. 7 different workers labeled all sentence pairs independently.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 22: [https://selectstar.ai/](https://selectstar.ai/)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We average 7 labels for each sentence pair and remove outliers following Agirre et al. [3], Cer et al. [13]. First, we filter out annotators showing Pearson\'s correlation < 0.80 or Krippendorff\'s alpha < 0.20 (nominal) [67] with others\' annotations. We exclude two annotators with this criteria so all sentence pairs have annotations from at least five people. Lastly, similarity score is rounded up to the first decimal place.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A few more filtering schemes are applied. First, we drop 14 pairs whose annotations are showing larger than 2 standard deviation. Those pairs might contain ambiguous expressions interpreted in various ways, or misannotations. Second, we ask workers to report the sentences including translation error or misinformation caused by RTT. We inspect the reported sentences and remove 418 sentence pairs. Third, we drop sentences involving ethical issues. Workers report the pairs if they are including any kind of hate speech, social bias, and potential personally identifiable information (PII). 1,213 sentence pairs were additionally removed after inspection. As a result, we have 13,224 sentence pairs in total. We report inter-annotator agreement (IAA) by using Krippendorff\'s alpha instead of Pearson\'s correlation because 7 annotators (or less) differ by pairs. The annotator agreed to each other\'s annotations. (Krippendorff\'s alpha (interval) = 0.85).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We observe the distribution of similarity score annotations differ between the _potentially_ similar sentence pairs and the less similar pairs. Figure 1 illustrates label distributions generated by RTT (top) and GSM (bottom) in AIRBNB. As expected, RTT pairs tend to show high similarity (from 3 to 5) while GSM pairs are considered less similar (from 0 to 3). Note that the number of GSM pairs scored 0 is high even we employ similarity-based matching. Similar tendencies are observed in POLICY and PARAKQC. By combining two distributions, we manage to obtain various sentence pairs in terms of similarity scores.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Final DatasetWe collect 13,224 sentence pairs and corresponding similarity scores. We split them to training, development, and test sets, considering the distribution of the scores. Even if we carefully sampled the pairs, the overall score distribution is not uniform across \\(0-5\\) as shown in Figure 1. However, we prefer uniform distribution at least in evaluation (development and test) set, in order to prevent evaluation bias toward a specific score. We therefore construct the evaluation set having approximately uniform distribution as shown in Figure 2. To this end, we divide the score range 0\\(-\\)5 to 51 bins, rounding up to the first decimal place of every scores. We try to balance the number of pairs across bins. Since some of them have small number of pairs, we try to fit all number of the pairs close to that number.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We also consider word overlap between sentences in each pair for evaluation set. Since larger word overlap might indicate higher semantic similarity, we try to reduce pairs satisfying such tendency to prevent the model from predicting similarity simply using word overlap. The overlap is measured by morpheme-level Jaccard distance by using MeCab [68]. We choose the pairs with the least word overlap from score 3\\(-\\)5, and the pairs with most word overlap from the rest. Such pairs are prioritized to be included to every bins in the dev and the test sets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We split the evaluation set with 1:2 ratio to construct the dev and the test sets, resulting in 519 and 1,037 pairs, respectively. The rest 11,668 pairs comprise the train set. Detailed numbers for each corpus are presented in Table 4. For all the sets, we balance the ratio between source corpora with that of the original pairs. Additionally, the scores are binarized with a threshold 3.0 same as paraphrase detection task.\n' +

Pearson\'s \\(r\\) is a measure of linear correlation between human-labeled sentence-similarity scores and model predicted scores, adopted in STS-b [13]. Since our dev and test set have a balanced score distribution, the coefficient correctly gives the magnitude of the relationship. F1 score is adopted to measure binarized results (_paraphrased / not paraphrased_). Specifically, our F1 reports results for the _paraphrased_ class.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Measuring similarity between sentences is a fundamental natural language understanding problem so that closely related to various NLP applications. Because of its importance, STS is included in various NLU benchmarks [133, 142]. To facilitate research in this area, many shared tasks have been held and annotated corpora are released [2, 3, 13]. Typically, they cover multiple text domains such as question pairs, image descriptions, news headlines, annotated with a real value from 0 (no meaning overlap) to 5 (meaning equivalence).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recently, Ham et al. [45] introduces a machine-translated Korean STS benchmark. This is a translation of [13] in GLUE, which contains around 8,600 sentence pairs in total. All examples are solely relying on machine translation, and sentence pairs in evaluation (dev and test) set are further post-edited by human. However, corresponding labels were not adjusted to translated meanings. Lack of re-labeling process would be problematic because Korean speakers would judge the similarity between them differently.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'If similarity labels are binarized by a certain threshold, STS also could be seen as paraphrase detection task such as Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) [32], Quora Question Pairs (QQP) [133], or PAWS [152] and PAWS-X [144]. Thus we additionally binarize our ground truths and predictions, reporting binary classification performance to see how well a model performs in paraphrase detection.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In paraphrase detection, Cho et al. [18] presents a benchmark that includes the human-generated queries for smart home, where ten paraphrase sentences are grouped together to make up a total of 1,000 groups. The granularity of scale is from 0 to 5, but the semantic similarity is judged only with attributes such as topic (smart home, weather, etc.) and speech act (question, prohibition, etc.), which does not consider other details such as nuance and syntactic structure because it lacks direct human judgement of similarity. PAWS-X [144] provides a translated version of PAWS [152] of Korean. Like KorSTS, the train split is machine-translated and its dev and test splits are human-translated, and corresponding labels are preserved without human inspection. There are also paraphrase corpora provided by government-funded institutions such as National Institute of Korean Language (NIKL) [98], but it simply provides human-generated and machine-paraphrased sentences with limited accessibility.\n' +

      '#### 3.2.4 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We create the first human-annotated Korean STS benchmark, KLUE-STS, that covers multiple domains and styles with free accessibility to everyone. The similarity score annotation process is specially designed to capture the characteristics of the Korean language. Covering the expressions from various domains, our benchmark is expected to be a useful resource for further research, beyond serving as a benchmark. Our benchmark helps to develop numerous models established on STS resources, such as SentenceBERT [115].\n' +

      '### Natural Language Inference (NLI)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The goal of natural language inference (NLI) is to train a model to infer the relationship between the _hypothesis_ sentence and the _premise_ sentence. Given a _premise_, an NLI model determines if _hypothesis_ is true (entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral). The task is also known as recognizing textual entailment (RTE) [27].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Understanding entailment and contradiction between sentences is fundamental to NLU. NLI datasets are also included in various NLU benchmarks such as GLUE [133] and superGLUE [132], and they are valuable as training data for other NLU tasks [24, 107, 115].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We formulate NLI as a classification task where an NLI model reads each pair of _premise_ and _hypothesis_ sentences and predicts whether the relationship is entailment, contradiction, or neutral. We use the classification accuracy to measure the model performance.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 3.3.1 Dataset Construction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We construct KLUE-NLI by using a collection method similar to that of SNLI [8] and MNLI [138]. First, we collect premise sentences from existing corpora. Then for each premise sentence, we ask one annotator to generate three new hypothesis sentences, one for each of the three relationship classes. Then for each pair of premise and hypothesis sentences, we ask four additional annotators to label the relationship for validation. We follow the criteria proposed by Williams et al. [138] to describe the three labels to the annotators. For both hypothesis generation and pair validation, we recruit workers from SelectStar,23 a Korean crowdsourcing platform.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 23: [https://selectstar.ai/](https://selectstar.ai/)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Source Corpora for Premise SentencesWe use six corpora for the set of premise sentences: WIKITREE, POLICY, WIKINEWS, WIKIPEDIA, NSMC and AIRBNB. They cover diverse topics and writing styles of contemporary Korean. WIKITREE, POLICY and WIKINEWS are news articles and WIKIPEDIA is a crowd-sourced encyclopedia, all of which are written in formal Korean. NSMC and AIRBNB consist of colloquial reviews in the domains of movies and travel, respectively.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'From the six corpora, we extract 10,000 premises with which we elicit hypotheses. A valid premise should satisfy three conditions. First, premise is a proposition, a declarative sentence to which we can assign a truth value, excluding mathematical formulae and lists. Second, a premise must include at least one predicate, and the predicate can be of diverse types such as states (e.g., be, believe, know), activities (e.g., play, smile, walk), achievements (e.g. realize, reach, break), and accomplishments (e.g. eat, build, paint). Third, the length of a premise should be from 20 to 90 characters including whitespace.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Annotation Protocol for Hypothesis GenerationWe show annotators a premise and ask them to write three hypotheses that correspond to each label. This allows us to collect nearly equal number of the (premise, hypothesis) pairs for each labels. We maintain the outline of the criteria as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* ENTAILMENT: The hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise is true\n' +
      '* CONTRADICITION: The hypothesis is necessarily false given the premise is true\n' +
      '* NEUTRAL: The hypothesis may or may not be true given the premise is true\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We are aware of the annotation artifacts coming from human writing-based hypothesis generation. Sentence length and explicit lexical patterns are highly associated with certain classes. Neutral sentences tend to be the longest among all classes, since workers can produce neutral hypothesis simply by introducing additional phrase or clause not stated in the premise. Negations such as "no", "never" and "nothing" are often accompanied with the class CONTRADICION [44, 108].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite the concerns of such artifacts, we stick to such a writing-based annotation procedure. Compared to automatic pipelines to collect hypotheses, human writing yields higher quality data and is still an effective protocol [131]. We focus on ways to encourage annotators to avoid injecting trivial patterns. We prepare guidelines with specific _Do_s and _Don_\'ts, and rigorously train the workers in advance. To minimize annotation artifacts, we instruct the annotators to write sentences with similar lengths across the classes, refrain from inserting certain lexical items repeatedly, and use as diverse strategies as possible when making inferences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Specifically, we provide detailed guidelines for hypothesis generation together with examples. We encourage annotators to create hypotheses that exhibit diverse linguistic phenomena, in terms of 1) lexical choice, 2) syntactic structures and 3) world knowledge. In the case of lexical choice, our guideline suggests annotators use synonyms/antonyms,hypernyms/hyponyms, and auxiliary particles. To introduce various syntactic structures, we provide several syntactic transformation strategies such as word scrambling, voice alteration, and causative alternation. Methods like subject/object swapping or passivization is motivated by existing NLI data augmentation strategies [89, 42]. We also encourage using expressions that reflect world knowledge such as time, quantity and geography in order to create a dataset grounded to the real world.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'There are a few more details in the guideline. We instruct annotators to maintain the writing style of the premise to create a balanced dataset in terms of the style as well. We also instruct them to skip sentences that are difficult to understand either due to the ungrammaticality or the complexity of the content. They are also instructed to skip and report sentences that contain ethical issues such as hate speech, social bias, or personally identifiable information. We examine all reported sentences and make final decisions whether to include the sentences in the dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Annotation Protocol for Label ValidationCrowdworkers annotate the relations of the resulting premise-hypothesis pairs for validation. For each of the pairs created, we ask four crowdworkers to supply a single label among (ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION, NEUTRAL). This yields a total of five labels per pair, including the initial label intended by the annotator who wrote the hypothesis sentence. For each validated sentence pair, we assign a gold label representing the majority of three or more votes out of five.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Annotation ProcessFor hypothesis generation, we go through a pilot phase where we iteratively update the guidelines and train the workers. During the pilot, we find writing a semantically unacceptable sentence or introducing a demonstrative pronoun not used in the premise could be potential problems. Since they might alter the intended label, we ask workers to avoid writing such sentences. The number of workers for this part of the annotation process is 11.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We then validate the relation labels for every pair. We go through a pilot phase, starting with 2,604 applicants in the pilot, then select 684 who passed the test to participate in the validation step. With 138 workers dropping out, the final number of workers is 546.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Validation results are summarized in Table 5. They suggest that our writing protocol is effective in producing a high quality corpus. The rate of unanimous gold labeled examples in KLUE-NLI is 18% higher than SNLI and MNLI. The higher the rate of such examples, the clearer the relationship between the generated hypothesis sentences and the original premise sentences. Individual annotator\'s agreement with the gold label and the author\'s label are also higher than SNLI and MNLI, and almost all pairs receive the gold label. Only a few sentence pairs (0.53%) lack the gold label, and we remove those before finalizing our dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Final DatasetThe final dataset consists of 30,998 sentence pairs that are divided into train/development/test sets. Table 6 shows the basic statistics of the dataset. As observed in SNLI and MNLI, our premise sentences also tend to be longer than the corresponding hypothesis sentences. This is because workers generally use partial information of a premise to write a hypothesis.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that we deliberately form the development and test sets in a way to 1) contain balanced source styles and 2) disincentivize models exploiting annotation artifacts. The development and the test set each contains 3,000 sentence pairs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To maintain consistency of style in development and test sets, we include in each set 60% formal and 40% colloquial sentences. We sample 450 sentences each from formal text WIKITREE, POLICY, WIKINEWS, WIKIPEDIA, and 600 sentences each from colloquial text NSMC, AIRBNB.\n' +

We call the label intended by the original annotator in writing the hypothesis “author’s label.” Consensus among three out of five annotators is ”gold label.”To prevent our NLI benchmark from incentivizing a model that predicts a label using a spurious cue in the hypothesis, we first fine-tune the KLUE-RoBERTa-base model using only the hypothesis sentences with their corresponding labels. If the model finds no clue between the hypothesis and the label, the predicted probability scores for each label should be uniform (i.e., one-third (\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)) when classified 3-way). Assuming that such score distribution is ideal, we prefer the pairs for development/test sets whose hypothesis-only model\'s predictions are closest to the ideal. We compute the distance between the prediction and the ideal using cross entropy. To preserve the intact sets of a premise and its three hypotheses, we calculate the mean distance of each set. We extract the sets whose mean distance is among the lowest 20%, and randomly split them into dev and test sets.\n' +

      'To measure human performance and examine whether KLUE-NLI test set improves upon KorNLI [45] test set, a machine-translation of the XNLI [25] test set, we conduct a round of human evaluation. We employ four native Korean undergraduates who major in Korean linguistics and did not participate in the KLUE-NLI construction process. We randomly sample 100 sentence pairs from KLUE-NLI test set and ask the workers to annotate them. We check the agreement of their annotations with the given gold label. We do the same on the subset of the KorNLI test set, to examine whether the human-elicited dataset improves the quality of the dataset. The results are shown in Table 7.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For KorNLI, 38% of the sentence pairs have responses from all four annotators that match with the gold labels. There are 18%, 18%, and 16% of sentences, respectively, when three, and two, and one response match with the gold label. 10 pairs do not match with the gold label. On the other hand, KLUE-NLI shows much higher agreement with the given gold label. All annotators agree with the gold label in 71% of the pairs, and 95% obtain at least three agreements. Furthermore, only 258 out of 400 (64.50%) individual annotations are the same as the gold label in KorNLI. Again, KLUE-NLI shows better agreement with the gold labels. 360 (91.00%) annotations are the same as the gold label.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'These numbers in annotation quality of KLUE-NLI are better than KorNLI as well as SNLI and MLNI. In KorNLI, annotators often report that they do not quite understand at least one of the two sentences or choose NEUTRAL because it is difficult to distinguish the semantic relationships of the sentences. Although the distribution of the gold label is uniform (respectively 33, 33, and 34% of entailment, contradiction, and neutral sentences), the label chosen most frequently by the annotators is NEUTRAL (56.75% on average). There are 26% of cases where the gold labels are different from the majority vote by the annotator. These results suggest that the annotators struggle to grasp the logical semantic relationship of KorNLI sentences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On the other hand, for KLUE-NLI, there is no case where none of the four responses matches the gold label. Considering the cases where more than two of the responses match the gold label, there is a 98% chance of the gold label to be re-selected as the majority tag. Compared to KorNLI, we can see that KLUE-NLI is a much more reliable dataset. This result also confirms that the headroom of our current best model (accuracy: 89.77%) is still there, given that the human accuracy, represented by the majority tag, is 98%.\n' +

      'Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) [27] is a task similar to NLI and was introduced in a series of textual entailment challenges. In the RTE task, two sentences are given, and the model decides whether the meaning of one sentence can be entailed from the other sentence. In earlier RTE 1-3, the task is binary, \'ENTAILMENT\' and \'NO ENTAILMENT\'. In RTE 4-5, a new class \'UNKNOWN\' is introduced, and the task is formulated as a three-way classification.\n' +

      'Two major datasets for NLI in English are Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) [8] and Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) [138].

SNLI is two orders of magnitude larger than the RTE corpora, made from 570,152 image captions in Flickr30k [148]. MNLI premise sentences are derived from 10 different sources, covering a wider range of styles, degrees of formality, and topics.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Most of the existing NLI datasets are in English, including SNLI and MNLI, and one common approach for constructing NLI datasets in other languages is to translate the existing English corpora to the language of interest. Conneau et al. [25] provides XNLI (Cross-lingual natural language inference) by employing professional translators to translate the development and test sets of MNLI into 15 languages. One main concern of the translation-based approach is whether the relation of the original sentence pair is maintained in the process. Conneau et al. [25] find some translated pairs lose the initial semantic relationship, validated by human annotators who re-annotate a sample of the dataset. The result demonstrates that human translations cause 2% misannotations given the 85% correct examples in the MNLI and 83% in XNLI.\n' +

      'Motivated by the fact that Korean is not included in XNLI, KorNLI [45] is introduced.

Although Ham et al. [45] also investigate the data manually and acknowledge some incorrect examples after the translation, no human validation process is performed to quantify the observation and leave analyzing such errors to future work.

KLUE-NLI represents diverse linguistic phenomena, writing style, degree of formality and contents that are most natural and suitable for Korean. The premise sentences of our dataset come from six Korean corpora, and the hypothesis sentences are written by well-trained workers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By keeping the writing-based protocol and thoroughly training workers based on detailed guidelines, we improve upon the existing NLI datasets in the reliability of the labels. KLUE-NLI shows much higher inter-annotator agreement rate than both the MNLI and the translation-based Korean dataset, KorNLI. The gap between the human performance scores of KLUE-NLI and KorNLI also provides evidence that KLUE-NLI is currently the optimal Korean NLI dataset.\n' +

      'Beyond its main purpose as an NLI benchmark dataset, we hope KLUE-NLI will be a useful resource for future NLU research, as English dataset such as MNLI and SNLI are extended [24, 107, 115].\n' +

      'Since NER is an important for application fields like syntax analysis, goal-oriented dialog system, question and answering chatbot and information extraction, various NLU benchmarks contains NER datasets [137, 57, 78, 54].

WIKITREE is a news article corpus and thus contains formal sentences with many entity types, which suits well as a source corpus for NER. NSMC includes colloquial reviews of movies or TV shows. Since the texts in NSMC are user-generated comments, they contain errata and non-normalized expressions, along with emojis and slang. Such a noisy dataset will help broaden the application field of NER models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The preprocessing of the two corpora is performed differently considering the characteristics of each corpus. For WIKITREE, since the news articles are mainly composed of well-written sentences, we simply split the articles into sentences. In contrast, the web texts from NSMC are written in the style of spoken language with blurry sentence boundaries. As each review is generally quite short and the sentences consisting it are on the same topic, we use each review as a single unit of input. In addition, the sentences that contain hate speech or socially biased terms are removed manually. For both corpora, we remove sentences longer than 400 characters.\n' +

      '### Relation Extraction (RE)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Relation extraction (RE) identifies semantic relations between entity pairs in a text. The relation is defined between an entity pair consisting of _subject entity_ (\\(e_{\\text{subj}}\\)) and _object entity_ (\\(e_{\\text{obj}}\\)). For example, in a sentence \'Kierkegaard\' was born to an affluent family in Copenhagen\', the subject entity is \'Kierkegaard\' and the object entity is \'Copenhagen\'. The goal is then to pick an appropriate relationship between these two entities; \'_place_of_birth_\'.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'RE is a task suitable for evaluating whether a model correctly understands the relationships between entities. In order to ensure KLUE-RE captures this aspect of language understanding, we include a large-scale RE benchmark. Because there is no large-scale RE benchmark publicly available in Korean, we collect and annotate our own dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We formulate RE as a single sentence classification task. A model picks one of predefined relation classes describing the relation between two entities within a given sentence. In other words, the RE model predicts an appropriate relation \\(r\\) of entity pair \\((e_{\\text{subj}},e_{\\text{obj}})\\) in a sentence \\(s\\), where \\(e_{\\text{subj}}\\) is the subject entity and \\(e_{\\text{obj}}\\) is the object entity. We refer to \\((e_{\\text{subj}},r,e_{\\text{obj}})\\) as a relation triplet. The entities are marked as corresponding spans in each sentence \\(s\\). There are 30 relation classes that consist of 18 person-related relations, 11 organization-related relations, and _no_relation_. Detailed explanation of these classes are presented in Table 10. We evaluate a model using micro F1 score, computed after excluding _no_relation_, and area under the precision-recall curve including all 30 classes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 3.5.1 Data Construction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Distant supervision [91] is a popular way to build a large-scale RE benchmark. It leverages relation triplets \\((e_{\\text{subj}},r,e_{\\text{obj}})\\) in existing large-scale knowledge base (KB) such as Freebase. If a sentence \\(s\\) in a large corpora includes \\((e_{\\text{subj}},e_{\\text{obj}})\\) detected by an NER model simultaneously, it is added to the dataset with relation label \\(r\\) by assuming any sentence which contains the pair will express that relation. This approach does not require expensive human annotation, thus allowing us to build a large-scale RE benchmark in a cost-effective way.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite this advantage, distant supervision often ends up with incorrect relation labels when the assumption is not satisfied. In particular, it only considers pairs of entities which are related to each other, which results in an RE model trained on such corpus to over-predict the existence of some relationship between any given pair of entities. In other words, the predicted relation class distribution from such predictors is not realistic [116]. Zhang et al. [153] and Nam et al. [93] thus propose to employ crowdworkers to alleviate erroneous relations extracted by distant supervision. Riedel et al. [116] furthermore intentionally collect irrelevant entity pairs to prevent RE models from overly predicting false positives relations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'OverviewWe modify the original strategy of distant supervision above, to address this weakness and to better fit our situation. First, we collect triplets \\((e_{\\text{subj}},r,e_{\\text{obj}})\\) from a small Korean KB29 and build additional ones by parsing the infoboxes in WIKIPEDIA and NAMUWIKI30 to enlarge the pool of the candidate triplets. We then ask crowdworkers to select the correct relation class of each candidate triplet within a sentence, compared to distant supervision which directly uses automatically generated relation labels. In addition, we randomly sample entity pairs in \\(s\\) to obtain more realistic relation class distribution in our benchmark. Those examples would include unseen entities in existing KB as well as have higher chance to be irrelevant (_no_relation_).\n' +

      '1. Collect Candidate SentencesWe sample candidate sentences from WIKIPEDIA, WIKITREE and POLICY corpora to cover a diverse set of named entities and relational facts.

      '2. Define Relation SchemaWe design a relation schema based on the schema from Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population (TAC-KBP) [87]. Our schema defines entity types and relation classes. Similar to TAC-KBP, we constrain \\(e_{\\text{subj}}\\) to be of either PER (Person) or ORG (Organization) type. \\(e_{\\text{obj}}\\) can have one of the following types: PER, ORG, LOC (Location), DAT (Date and time), POH (Other proper nouns), and NOH (Other numerals). For the relation classes, we adapt the original classes in TAC-KBP to our corpus, following Yu et al. [149].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We remove rarely appearing relation classes in our corpus such as _org:website_, _per:shareholders_, _per:cause_of_death_, _per:charges_, and _per:age_. For the same reason, we incorporate _org:parents_ into _org:member_of_ and _org:subsidiaries_ into _org:members_. Since the taxonomy of TAC-KBP does not precisely reflect the regional hierarchy of Korea, we integrate the prefixes _country_of_, _city_of_, and _stateoprovince_of_ into _place_of_. We introduce additional classes frequently appearing in our corpus such as _org:product_, _per:product_ and _per:colleague_:\n' +

      '* _org:product_: A product or merchandise produced by an organization. This includes intangible goods such as an event hosted and a business launched by the organization.\n' +

      '* _per:colleague_: A person could be a colleague of someone if they work together. Two people in the same group such as political party or alliance are colleagues as well.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. Detect EntitiesWe automatically detect named entities in all candidate sentences. We fine-tune a pre-trained ELECTRA for Korean32 to build two named entity recognition (NER) models on two existing Korean NER resources respectively. One is provided by National Institute of Korean Language [98], and the other is built by Korea Maritime & Ocean University.33 We modify the named entity types defined in these resources to be compatible with our own entity types previously defined in the schema. We take the union of both models\' predictions to extract as many entities as possible. We use crowdsourcing to correct incorrect boundaries of the detected entities, as described later.\n' +

We collect these triplets from two sources. First, we create the initial pool of triplets, using a Korean KB.34 Because the number of triplets (\\(\\sim\\)800k) from the Korean KB is small compared to, for instance, that of Freebase (\\(\\sim\\)2b), we enlarge this pool of triplets by gathering and then parsing infoboxes in WIKIPEDIA and Namuwiki. In order to avoid over-inclusion of frequent entities, such as the President of Korea, we set an upper bound to the number of co-occurrence between \\((e_{\\text{subj}},e_{\\text{obj}})\\) during sampling [153].\n' +

      'In the second approach, \\((e_{\\text{subj}},e_{\\text{obj}})\\) is uniformly sampled from the entire entity set \\(E\\) of a given sentence \\(s\\), at random. Because there is no cue whether a sampled pair has any relation between them, the pair is highly likely to be irrelevant (_no_relation_). Irrelevant pairs will account for a large portion of realistic relation distribution between two arbitrary entities. Therefore, this approach helps to set up real-world scenario. Such a pair is also likely to contain entities that are not selected in the first approach. This leads to capturing entity pairs and their relations independent of KBs.\n' +

We instruct workers to focus on the current relationship, not ones from the past. For instance, if a person described in a sentence is a former member of a certain organization, workers are asked not to choose the relation _per:employee_of_. We also ask them to avoid relying on external knowledge, or common sense, to infer the relation from the context solely within a given sentence.

      'Many researchers attempt to build KBs from unstructured text through automatically identifying relational facts between entity pairs in plain text by applying machine learning techniques. Doddington et al. [31] and Hendrickx et al. [52] construct English datasets to train such models, including a relatively small number of relation classes for general domain text. Mintz et al. [91] further propose distant supervision to automatically annotate plain text by aligning it to the schema of KBs. This allows researchers to scale up the size of RE datasets [116, 147, 149, 153, 48]. Among these recent studies, TACRED [153] is the most widely used dataset, built based on the popular relation schema TAC-KBP [87] which mainly focuses on person and organization entities. Specifically, TACRED contains 106,264 examples annotated with the 42 relation classes. Yu et al. [149] also proposes a dialogue-based RE task by refining TAC-KBP to obtain 36 relation classes adapted for the dialogue domain. We also follow TAC-KBP to build the relation schema and modify them suitable for our situation.\n' +

It however has a relatively small test set (\\(\\sim\\)3k), making it difficult to evaluate performance for the total 49 relation classes properly. Moreover, since there is no negative class (_no_relation_ in ours), it is likely to encourage models to overly predict false positives [153]. We thus consider KLUE-RE as a standard large-scale RE benchmark to properly evaluate Korean language models.\n' +

KLUE-RE can not only be used for online information extraction but also contribute to building a large-scale knowledge graph from unstructured texts. We therefore expect KLUE-RE to be a starting point for building a large-scale, ever-growing public KB in Korean, as well as a valuable Korean NLU benchmark.\n' +

      'The Penn Treebank [84] is a constituency parsed dataset created from 1989 to 1996. It has a size of about 3 million words, including IBM computer manuals, nursing notes, Wall Street Journal articles, phone conversations. A total of 48 POS tags and 18 syntax tags are used by combining meta tags such as symbols. The Penn Treebank was the best-known parsing data set before dependency parsing became prevalent. Later studies convert the Penn Treebank to dependency parsing [86, 20].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A representative DP corpus is the Universal Dependencies(UD) dataset.40 UD is de facto standard of DP data, aiming for a unified treebank annotation in various languages. Google Universal POS [106] composed of 12 tags, was developed and a corpus was built that applied it to 25 different languages. Also de Marneffe and Manning [28] studied guidelines for dependency parsing markers used in Stanford parsers [65]. The Universal Dependency Treebank Project in 2013 attempted to combine the two studies above to have a consistent annotation system for multiple languages. UD started by modifying and supplementing this. UD first started in 2015 and Nivre et al. [97] and 10 corpora in a total of 10 languages were released through the website. As of 2021, UD (UD 2.7v) offers 104 languages and 183 corpora.\n' +

      'Footnote 40: [https://universaldependencies.org](https://universaldependencies.org)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The corpus constructed with UD scheme is made according to a certain structure called CoNLL-U format. Since UD aims to study general linguistic universality by using the same tag and annotation system in different languages, a unified format for integrating and managing each corpus is needed. The CoNLL-U format is a modified version of this CoNLL format so that it can well represent Universal dependency parsing. CoNLL-U format consists of 10 columns, each column display a word index (ID), word form (FORM), lemma of word form (LEMMA), universal part-of-speech tag (UPOS), language-specific part- It represents of-speech tag (XPOS), list of morphological features (FEATS), head of the current word (HEAD), dependency relation (DEPREL), enhanced dependency graph (DEPS), any other annotation (MISC). In this format, each word stands on a line along with different associated features (word form, lemma, POS tag, etc.) and we adopt this format in our final dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In Korean, DP corpus is divided into those that follow the UD scheme and those that do not. Among the former are The Google Korean Universal Dependency Treebank (GKT), The KAIST Korean Universal Dependency Treebank (KTB), and The Penn Korean Universal Dependency Treebank (PKT). These three datasets are converted from The Google Korean Treebank [86], The Kaist Treebank [128], and The Penn Korean treebank [47] according to the UD scheme, respectively [20]. These were first automatically converted according to the head-finding rule and then heuristically modified. These are composed of 6k, 27k, and 5k sentences, respectively, and include the genres of blog, newswire, literature, academic, and manuscript. Among them, PKT was revised by changing the analysis unit and several rules to further reveal the characteristics of Korean [99].\n' +

      'Corpora that do not follow the UD scheme include the TTA DP Corpus built by Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) and the Modu Corpus [98] built by the National Institute of the Korean Language (NIKL). Both corpora follow the CoNLL format, and use their own tagset, which was developed from the 21st century Sejong Plan corpus. The syntactic analysis corpus of the 21st century Sejong Plan is constructed according to the constituency grammar, following a scheme similar to the Penn Treebank. Unlike the dependency grammar, which grasps only the dominant relationship between two words, the constituency grammar identifies the relationship between words hierarchically. However, since Korean has relatively free word order, dependency parsing is more suitable than phrase-structure parsing. Studies on converting the 21st century Sejong Plan corpus into DP format have been conducted, and since then, corpora that use the 21st century Sejong Plan\'s tagset but follow dependency parsing have been constructed. The size of TTA DP corpus is about 27k, and the Modu corpus about 2000k. Unlike UD, which emphasizes general linguistic characteristics, better represents the characteristics of Korean as an individual language, and serves as a national standard for Korean DP tagging. Also, there are already corpus annotated according to the TTA scheme, so we consider compatibility between them and our benchmark. For this reason, we constructed the KLUE-DP using the TTA tagset.\n' +

This guideline is customized to reflect the characteristics of Korean (agglutinative, free word order, etc.), and it also tackles omission of predicates in web data or errors in spacing.

      '### Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a task designed to evaluate models\' abilities to read a given text passage and then answer a question about the passage, that is, its ability of comprehension.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Most of existing, widely-used MRC benchmarks are largely in English [21, 56, 60, 112, 113, 145, 150]. Those resources are widely used in evaluating pre-trained language models since it is one of the most intuitive methods for measuring text comprehension. SQuAD 1.1 [112] and SQuAD 2.0 [113] are popular evaluation tasks along with GLUE [30, 82, 22, 71]. BooIQ [21], ReCoRD [150], and MultiRC [60] are selected as a member of SuperGLUE for rigorous evaluation of language models. Recently, open-domain QA task which can be viewed as an MRC task without a given text passage [69, 56, 145, 38], is included in a knowledge-intensive NLP task benchmark [105].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Motivated by those datasets, MRC has become an essential task in NLU benchmarks for various languages such as Indonesian [137], Chinese [142], and Russian [125]. In Korean, however, an appropriate MRC benchmark is not available because existing Korean MRC datasets are either less challenging, limited in access, or simply machine-translated from an English dataset [79, 1, 74]. We therefore include MRC in KLUE and create a new challenging Korean MRC benchmark (KLUE-MRC) with the following contributions:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Providing multiple question types**: In order to evaluate different aspects of MRC capability of models, we provide three question types: paraphrase, multi-sentence reasoning, and unanswerable. We collect questions by following strict guidelines with specific sets of rules for each type.\n' +
      '* **Preventing reasoning shortcuts**: We prevent MRC models from exploiting reasoning shortcuts with simple word-matching by enforcing lexical and syntactic variations when workers generate questions. Also, we aim to generate questions which can be answered by considering the full query sentence.\n' +
      '* **Multiple passage domains accessible to everyone** : We include news domain passages as well as Wikipedia. To guarantee CC BY-SA license of KLUE-MRC, we made signed contracts with corresponding news providers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We formulate MRC as a task of predicting the answer span of the question from the given text passage. The input is a concatenated sequence of the question and the passage separated with a delimiter. The output is the start and end positions of the predicted answer span within the passage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We evaluate models with two metrics: 1) exact match (EM) and 2) character-level ROUGE-W. Note that character-level ROUGE-W is different from the character-level F1 score used in the previous Korean MRC datasets. If the question is unanswerable within the given passage, the model should predict the empty answer string. The motivation of our metrics are described in Section 3.7.2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 3.7.1 Dataset Construction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Source CorporaFirst, we collect passages from Korean WIKIPEDIA and news articles provided by The Korea Economy Daily and ACROFAN. WIKIPEDIA articles are one of the most commonly used resources for creating MRC datasets. We additionally include news articles reporting contemporary social issues to enhance diversity of passages. They are provided by The Korea Economy Daily and ACROFAN. As news articles are generally copyrighted work, we sign a contract with the news providers to use and redistribute the articles under CC BY-SA license only for building a dataset for machine learning purposes. We believe multi-domain corpus can help MRC models enhance their generalizability.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We preprocess the corpus to collect passages. For WIKIPEDIA articles, we remove duplicates in other existing Korean MRC benchmarks (e.g., KorQuAD) for precise evaluation of models. Then, we split each article by its sections to obtain passages. For the news articles, we filter out political articles and articles belonging to categories which have less than 100 articles. We finally gather all preprocessed passages whose length is longer than 512 and shorter than 2048 in characters.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Annotation ProtocolWe annotate questions and answers by giving passages to crowdworkers. We provide a detailed tutorial session to introduce our guidelines. 60 out of 80 workers are selected after a pilot test of creating 15 question-answer pairs with a given passage. The selected workers generate questions and label corresponding answers spans (for Types 1 and 2) or fake answers spans (for Type 3). We use Tagtog annotation toolkit 41 for the annotation. We assign three inspectors for each question type to validate the generated questions and answers following common and type-specific guidelines. If the generated question-answer pair fails to pass the inspection, the worker refines it based on the feedback given by the inspector.\n' +

The requestable slots provide additional information that a user may ask, but not necessarily need to be specified as a user goal constraint. A typical example of a requestable slot is "phone number", which a user may ask for, but would not work to narrow down the probable candidates of the goal [50, 51].\n' +

The boolean type slots can have either _yes_ or _no_ as their values, such as "Parking (availability)" and "(has) swimming pool". Such boolean type values do not appear in the dialogue context explicitly. In other words, they have abstractive properties. A model which understands abstractive properties is desirable, so we have much more boolean type slots than MultiWOZ [10]; WoS has 20 boolean slots across the domains while MultiWOZ includes only 2. Meanwhile, the required slots have to be specified with values in order to fill out a user intent.

      'We provide a goal instruction for a user side role. The instruction includes descriptions of a user\'s specific goal with corresponding slot values in natural language.

      '\n' +
      'To devise a multi-domain dialogue scenario where slots are shared across multiple domains, we include _domain transition_ in the instruction [10, 154]. For example, in case of a user aiming to book a hotel, the user might seek information about transportation (taxi, metro, etc.) to get there. In this dialogue, initial domain is changed to another (hotel to taxi/metro). It is more challenging compared with single domain in terms of dialogue state tracking. Because user could express their goal implicitly where values should be inferred by co-referencing other values of preceding domains.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The goal instructions are realized by the templates containing placeholders for goal constraining slots and their values. We design diverse templates for each domain, in order to cover various scenarios of the dialogues. Like MultiWOZ, the goal templates include a series of subgoals with corresponding slots. We carefully design the sentences to promote lexical entailment or co-referencing during conversation, which can be naturally observed in the user context or during the domain transition. When filling a template to complete instructions, we randomly assign the instances from KB built upon the domain-specific task schema to the given placeholders. The values of the instruction should be specifically mentioned by a user during a conversation. Each trackable slot either has valid values, _None_ or _Doncare_.50\n' +

      'To properly evaluate a model\'s generalization ability, we further add counterfactual goals and introduce unseen KB instances during the process [77]. To add new goal instruction based on the current slot distribution, we keep monitoring the slot value frequency and co-occurrence over slots during the construction. Specifically, we add new goal instructions which cover infrequent slot values or rarely co-occurring combination among slots. For example, when "(hotel-parking, no)" is infrequent pair in the as-is distribution, we promote it to appear in dialogues by designing goal instruction including it as constraint. Moreover, we differentiate KB instances between particular subset of dataset (train and dev/test set) to simulate realistic scenario regarding unseen slot values in the test time.\n' +

The annotation of a dialogue state is an explicit action of understanding a user request to fully focus on providing the required information. Then, the wizard generates response either to request or to convey information. If the values of required slots are absent, the system side worker is allowed to ask for the missing values to the user. Otherwise, the system provides the user with the adequate information. We enable the system to query the external knowledge base, if needed. When there are more than three search results, the system worker could request more details or recommend one among them.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To support the wizard to perform such complicate work effectively and efficiently, we provide a graphical web interface with a newly introduced feature: dropdown components (Figure 3.8.1). Dropdown interface enables the system side worker can choose a value from a list of pre-populated candidates. We present most probable value candidates based on the goal instruction and domain-specific knowledge base, since a dropdown might become worthless when too many options are presented to workers. This procedure naturally prevents several type of annotation errors, such as _multi-annotations_, _mis-annotations_, _typos_, and _value canonicalization_ reported in MutiWOZ 2.1 [37].\n' +
      '\n' +
      '4. Dataset ConstructionWe adapt \'Self-dialog\' scheme inspired by taskmaster-1 [11] to efficiently collect diverse dialogue dataset while reducing the cost and time. Self-dialog is effective to collect various dialogue data. By having both roles, a worker freely controls a flow of dialogue such as the order of slot occurrence in user utterances and recommendation of system responses. This also leads workers to speak their own styles naturally such that different personas are included. However, we found annotation errors in pilot phase such as _early-markup_ (system pre-fills the values before receiving the values from the user) and _delayed-markup_ (the system fills the values behindhand the proper turn) errors. We further improve the scheme by utilizing explicit turn-switching between user and system roles with providing error correction interface.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To elaborate, we train and select trustworthy workers to participate in the main collection process. Prior to the main phase, we conduct several pilot studies with crowdworkers to avoid aforementioned early-markups and delayed-markup errors, and to generate more realistic dialogues including some miscommunications. We also implement an explicit turn-switching between the two roles, in order to immerse themselves in a user/system role, which mitigates overly reduced miscommunications as well. Throughout the pilot, we finally employ 15 selected workers who can effectively handle such issues.\n' +

JGA measures the proportion of exactly matched dialogue state which consists of a set of slot-value pairs with the ground truth dialogue state among the total number of dialogue turns. Slot micro F1 score is an average of micro F1 scores in each turn. For each turn, micro F1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall in terms of predicted slot-value pairs and ground-truth pairs. Note that the slot micro F1 score ignores when value of the ground truth is "None".\n' +

      'When splitting the train and dev/test set based on the counterfactual goals and unseen KB instances, like Li et al. [77], we observe performance drop as shown in Table 27. This demonstrates that the counterfactual goal makes WoS more challenging.\n' +

      '#### 3.8.4 Related Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) [59] is a popular scheme in dialogue collection. In fact, conventional WOZ setting allows to collect various type of dialogues by employing role-playing of two humans. Each human should choose a role between the two: _user_ and _system_. As taking a role, dialogues are collected by turn-taking generation of utterances with background information provided in advance. In the case of building a task-oriented dialogue, _goal_ is given to a _user_ while _knowledge base_ is allowed to be accessed to _system_. The _system_ can use its _knowledge base_ when responding to _user_\'s request.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Many dialogue datasets closely follow WOZ settings [135, 35, 36], however, it costs a lot of time and money because two crowdworkers must be matched at the same time and successfully play each role, which prevents collecting dialogues at scale. We refer this limitation to \'worker coexistence constraints\'. To overcome the limitation, MultiWOZ [10] slightly change this conventional WOZ to _asynchronously_ collect dialogues turn-by-turn from crowdworkers, which allows different workers to play the same _user_ or _system_ in a single dialogue. This approach costs less but error-prone because every worker must adapt to dialogue already progressed so that their response might be incoherent to the previous context [37]. Recently, CrossWOZ and RiSAWOZ thus pair only selected trustworthy workers to collect dialogues in _synchronous_ manner as suggested in the WOZ settings to keep the annotation quality despite the high construction cost [154, 109].\n' +

      'Byrne et al. [11] also argue that conventional WOZ settings are time consuming, complex and expensive, requiring considerable technical implementation as well as administrative procedures to train and manage both agents and crowdsourced workers, accordingly suggesting Self-dialog as an alternative. Self-dialog is a collection scheme in which workers write the entire dialogue playing both user and system roles. To demonstrate their idea, Byrne et al. [11] build a large-scale dialogue dataset, Taskmaster-1, which is built upon the Self-dialog which stands on the WOZ schemes: 1) two people playing user and system roles (conventional WOZ setting) and 2) one person playing both roles (Self-dialog). As a result, Self-dialog can remedy the cost of \'worker coexistence constraint\' effectively with avoiding incoherent dialogue generation caused by asynchronous dialogue collection. However, there is a tendency that little miscommunication occurs in the dialogue which compared to the real world conversations because the same person produces utterances in both roles, which might lead to a gap from reality.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Some researchers further tries to employ only machines to create such dialogues to maximize cost-efficiency. It builds the dialogues on top of a simulator which is able to create utterances by turn automatically from elaborately designed rules and given task schema. The simulator first generates psuedo-dialogue, then adopts crowdsourcing to paraphrase them to the natural utterances [124, 114]. It requires much less human effort, however, heavily relies on the simulator.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Meanwhile, previous works exists addressing robust evaluation of DST models. According to CoCo [77], state-of-the-art DST models are not robust to realistic scenarios since they scarcely appear in the train data. As the name CoCo (controllable counterfactuals) suggests, it generates infrequent but realistic dialogues based on the predefined slot-value pairs. They show that even a state-of-the-art DST model\'s performance drops significantly when they are evaluated on such dialogues including counterfactual goals. It means the current TOD benchmarks should be improved in terms of robustness to unseen but realistic scenarios.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As for Korean, there is a task-oriented dialog dataset is provided by National Information Society Agency (NIA). It covers about 10 domains related to the civil complaints and consists of more than 500k dialogues. The utterances are divided into four types: 1) a main question that a user asks, 2) a sub question that a system could ask for clarification, 3) a user answer, and 4) a system answer. Additionally, user intents are annotated and entities are extracted from each utterance. We find that this dataset does not follow any of the aforementioned settings; there is no dialogue state represented as slot-value pairs, only regarding single turn judgement. It also lacks information about task schema and redistribution is restricted which does not satisfy our accessibility principle, which motivates us to newly create a DST benchmark.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We introduce Wizard-of-Seoul (WoS), the first large-scale Korean multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset that simulates conversations between Seoul tourists and travel agents. We adapt \'Self-dialog\' for efficiently scaling up of dialogue collection scheme. In addition, consideration on annotation interfaces (drop-down menu and turn-switching) mitigates erroneous cases and diverse goal instructions including counterfactual ones promote each conversation to be more natural and challenging. We hope that WoS sparks various future dialogue research in Korean and also offers valuable insights to pushing forward end-to-end dialogue modeling.\n' +

Second, it is a challenging problem on its own to automatically detect socially biased contents or hate space, as both of these highly depend on the context in which they appear [62]. Lastly, being blind to such harmful contents prevents the future use of a language model for detecting and correcting these harmful contents, such as using it as an anti-expert [81]. We expect future research on the pretrained language models we release to focus on how to detect and correct biases encoded in these models and on how to debias them, as has been recently demonstrated by Cheng et al.

For morpheme segmentation, we use Mecab-ko,60 McCab [68] adapted for Korean, and for BPE segmentation, we use the wordpiece tokenizer from Huggingface Tokenizers library.61 We specify the vocabulary size to 32k.

We employ an encoder-decoder model following the architecture of TRADE [140], which consists of an utterance encoder, a state generator, and a slot gate classifier (Figure 5.1.3). In our implementation, we change the utterance encoder from GRU [17] to PLM to get better representations. Thus, the state generator takes the final hidden state of [CLS] token \\(h_{0}\\) as the first decoder hidden state. We also modify the slot gate classifier to predict additional two slot gate labels (_yes_, _no_), since WoS contains relatively more Boolean type slots than MultiWOZ [10].

See Figure 9 for an example. We linearly map each of the final hidden states from the encoder \\(h\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|x|\\times H}\\) into a 12-dimensional real-valued vectors, corresponding to the 12 named-entity categories.

The final hidden state of each token in the passage is linearly projected to a 2-dimensional real-valued vector. The dimensions in this vector correspond to the logits of two binary classifiers, the start and end token classifiers.

Similarly to KLUE-NER, we must be careful in handling subword tokens, as the annotation is done at the word level. In our approach, we use a pretrained language model (to be fine-tuned) to extract subword representations and concatenate the first and last subword token representations of each word, to form word vector representations. Each of these word representations is optionally concatenated with the part-of-speech embedding. For the attention layers, we use biaffine attention [33] to predict HEAD, and bilinear attention [64] to predict arc type (DEPREL) for each word. Just like KLUE-NER and KLUE-MRC, we minimize the cross-entropy loss to fine-tune the entire model. See Figure 10 for a graphical illustration of the model architecture.\n' +

      'In this section, we present the evaluation results including our KLUE-PLMs and existing PLMs on the KLUE benchmark, in Table 32.63 Different from other NLU benchmarks, we do not average the scores over tasks, since simple averaging of scores of different scales and interpretations could be highly misleading. Rather, we describe and discuss the result of each task separately. Within the Korean BASE models, KLUE-BERTBASE performs best for YNAT and WoS, KLUE-RoBERTBASE for KLUE-RE and KLUE-MRC, and KoELECTRABASE for KLUE-STS and KLUE-NLI.\n' +

      'We make two major observations. First, we see that KLUE-RoBERTBASE, which is the largest model among the baseline PLM\'s we tested, outperforms all the other models across all the tasks except for KLUE-NER. This observation agrees well with the recent trend which has demonstrated the correlation between the model size and task performance [58; 9]. This indicates that KLUE will be useful for the future investigation into how much gain we can expect by simply increasing the model size further. The second observation is that the monolingual models, which were specifically designed for and trained with a more carefully curated corpus in the target language (Korean), generally outperform the multilingual counterparts, especially when we compare models of similar sizes. We make this observation again across all the tasks, except for KLUE-NER, where the XLM-RLARGE performs similarly to the best performer, KoELECTRABASE, in terms of character-level F1 score. This observation re-iterates the importance of investing effort in understanding a target language and customizing data, models and learning algorithms for the target language.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Corpus PseudonymizationIt can be expected that noise introduced in the process of pseudonymization may have detrimental effect on the downstream task performance. Our finding, presented in Table 33, however shows that there is some drop in a subset of the tasks, but such drop is quite minimal. This suggests that the minimal level of pseudonymization, just like what we have done, is already a good way to balance the task performance and the risk of leaking private information.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We contrast our tokenization scheme, _morpheme-based subword_ tokenization, against the standard byte pair encoding (BPE). First, we investigate the difference in how words are segmented into subword tokens. Following Rust et al. [119], we consider subword fertility, proportion of continued words, and UNK ratio. On the subword fertility, which measures the average number of subwords produced per word, the proposed tokenization scheme ends up slightly higher than BPE does. However, when we look at the proportion of continued words, which measures the number of words that were split into at least two subwords, we observe the opposite trend. This implies that our algorithm maintains the original words as much as it can, and only when it is necessary, it splits each word into potentially more subword pieces. The efficacy of the proposed scheme over BPE is evident from the UNK ratio, as it produces fewer UNK tokens compared to BPE when the vocabulary size was controlled to be 32k for both methods. See Table 35.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We find these qualitative differences between two schemes lead to significant differences in the task performance in the cases of KLUE-NER, KLUE-MRC and WoS. These tasks often involve tagging, detection and even generation at the morpheme level, and we suspect that morphologically consistent tokenization facilitates better prediction overall. On the other hand, the difference in the tokenization strategy does not manifest itself in the performance of classification or word-level tagging, likely as a corresponding NLU system can more readily overcome inconsistencies in subword segmentation when merging subword token representations into that of a larger unit. Overall, we recommend future researchers use the proposed tokenization strategy as a default option.\n' +

      'Source CorporaOur goal is to secure and maximize the continued availability and usefulness of the benchmark. In other words, we must guarantee the possibility of derive new work and redistribute it freely, which comes together with CC BY-SA. To release KLUE under CC BY-SA, we have built a source corpus set by including only text that is either 1) not protected by copyright or 2) under CC0, CC BY, CC BY-SA or KOGL Type 1 license.

Unfortunately without these corpora, it is not possible to find a sufficiently large resource to train large-scale language models for Korean. We thus use them for pretraining but do not publicly release the pretraining corpora in order to avoid any issues in the future, which is in contrast to KLUE.

Second, we explicitly and clearly instruct annotators to mark any instance that exhibits social biases and/or is toxic (see Section 3), after providing them with clear definitions of bias and hate speech. Finally, we manually examine these marked sentences and exclude them from the final dataset. This three-stage process may not catch all possible such instances, and we plan to use an online forum65 to receive feedback and complaints from users of KLUE.\n' +

Second, it is challenging to build an automated tool to detect hate speech and biased sentences. This issue is made even more severe for Korean, because there is only one known hate speech dataset of limited size [92]. Lastly, we envision the future in which these pretrained language models are used to build better tools for automatically detecting various toxic contents as well as undesirable social biases.

      'General-Purpose NLU BenchmarksGeneral Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) [133] benchmark, a collection of evaluation dataset for English, was the first general-purpose evaluation benchmarks for NLU. It is general-purpose in that it is not limited to a single task. It consists of 11 downstream tasks, including tasks that measures the capability of capturing semantic textual similarity (QQP, MRPC, STS) [3, 13], measures the capability of inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, WNLI) [8, 138] and that evaluates the capability of classifying a single sentence into a predefined set of categories (CoLA, SST) [134, 126]. GLUE exclusively focused on English, and its variants in different languages have been built and released over the past couple of years, including CLUE in Chinese [142], a French version [72], an Indonesian version [137], a version for Indic languages [57], Russian SuperGLUE [125], and Persian GLUE [61]. In all these cases, substantial efforts were carried out to follow the philosophy of the original GLUE, covering a broad spectrum of domains and tasks, while incorporating language-specific characteristics. On the other hand, there have been efforts to build a multilingual version of such benchmark, largely relying on automated methods, such as XGLUE [78] and XTREME [54]. Korean as a language has been included in subsets of these latter benchmarks, but there has not been a serious attempt at building a general-purpose language understanding evaluation suite for Korean, until this paper.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Absence of a Standard NLU Benchmark in KoreanUntil this paper, a number of task-specific benchmarks in Korean have been proposed and released. For example, NSMC is used for sentiment classification, PAWS-X [144] for paraphrase detection, KorNLI and KorSTS [45] for NLI and STS, KorQuAD 1 and 2 [79, 63] for MRC, and BEEP! [92] for hate speech detection. At this point, one may wonder whether it would have been easier and more convenient to simply aggregate these datasets to build KLUE. After all, this has been a popular strategy for constructing monolingual [133] as well as multilingual [78, 54] benchmarks. Unfortunately this approach comes with two major issues that we directly address in this paper.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'First, the existing datasets are constructed individually without considering other datasets and their properties. In other words, the aggregate of these individual datasets is unlikely to cover a broad spectrum of domains and writing styles, unlike KLUE for which we carefully curate the source corpora as well as subsets for downstream tasks to have broad coverage of domains and styles. This goes beyond domains and styles, but also the coverage of linguistic phenomena under evaluation. Most of the existing benchmarks, listed above, focus on semantics rather than syntax, and it is difficult to find any widely-available benchmark that captures pragmatics. We address this issue by carefully selecting a set of downstream tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Second, these existing datasets are not always publicly available,67 and some are distributed with a highly restrictive license that prohibits redistribution nor the transformation of the original. These are often the ones published and released by government-affiliated institutes. In some cases, it is necessary to obtain a special permission to access datasets, which is often not easily accessible by non-Korean researchers. We address all these issues with KLUE by relaseing the entire benchmark data under CC BY-SA, both by careful curation of source corpora and by direct agreements with publishers.\n' +

      'Pretrained Language Models (PLMs)The recent trend of large-scale pretrained language models was sparked by the success of earlier models, such as ELMo [104], GPT-2 [110] and BERT [30], on the GLUE and other similar NLU benchmarks. This earlier success has led to a series of advances in large-scale language models, including XLNet [146], ALBERT [71], RoBERTa [82], ELECTRA [22], and Deberta [49], again largely driven by the availability of standardized benchmarks. This advance in language models, not only in terms of the model size but also in learning algorithms, in turn also sparked the interest in building and improving existing language understanding benchmarks. Some of the recently released, challenging benchmarks include SuperGLUE [132] and KILT [105]. The availability of such a standard language understanding benchmark, such as KLUE from this paper, is expected to start such a virtuous cycle for Korean language understanding.\n' +

In addition, one can improve our benchmark to build more challenging datasets after performance saturation. To function as a NLU _benchmark_, open access is a must. If the original author does not allow derivative development of the benchmark, other researchers cannot improve it, for example by removing toxic content, or building a more challenging dataset to accelerate research for technical improvements. If commercial use is not allowed, researchers working at for-profit organizations would not be able to benefit from nor to (easily) contribute to the benchmark. Redistribution is another crucial factor because it significantly limits research if, for example, sharing the datasets with another researcher is prohibited. Another existing practice that limits research is transferring the responsibility of copyright infringement of related conflicts to researchers. To set a good precedent for open access of data, we allow using our datasets for 1) any purpose, 2) derivative work, and 3) redistribution, as long as the existing copyrights in our benchmark datasets are respected. We also open our pretrained Korean language models and the implementation of pretraining and fine-tuning pipelines. This enhances reproducibility of our work, and allows anyone to fix and improve our data and models. We hope to contribute to the Korean NLP research community as well the wider NLP community.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Facilitating Korean NLP ResearchWe developed KLUE with the aim of facilitating Korean NLP research, in response to the recent active development efforts of large Korean language models. The entire NLP community has seen BERT [30] and its variants outperforming the previous NLU models for GLUE [133] and SuperGLUE [132], as well as the more recent GPT3 [9] with outstanding performance without fine-tuning (and with _in-context learning_) in natural language understanding and generation. Motivated by these models, many Korean researchers at various institutions rushed to pretrain large-scale Transformer-based Korean language models. Consequently, a number of nearly identical pretrained language models have been released to open-source communities. However, we could not systematically understand the behaviors and characteristics of these models because of the lack of well-designed general-purpose benchmarks like GLUE for Korean. KLUE will allow us to conduct controlled experiments to understand how and why various Korean LMs perform on certain tasks and thus obtain detailed insights into those models. Furthermore, since KLUE includes many representative NLU tasks that are also conducted in other languages, KLUE will function as a fundamental resource to NLP researchers who aim to conduct multilingual research with Korean and other languages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Measuring Overall Performance of NLU modelsWe do not average all scores gained from each task in KLUE. The performance of all tasks are measured by different evaluation metrics. This is because we carefully choose the metric for each task with considering its own characteristics. Their granularity differs by tasks, for example, KLUE-MRC and KLUE-NER employ character-level metrics because an entity can exist within a word in Korean whereas KLUE-STS and KLUE-NLI use sentence-level metrics. Furthermore, we use various metrics across tasks, such as F1 score, accuracy, area under the curve, UAS, LAS, ROUGE-W, joint goal accuracy, and Pearson\'s correlation. In this situation, simply computing the average of all tasks as in GLUE [133] results in misleading overall performance measure. The average will lose its interpretability as well as giving higher weights to a certain task in unintended ways. Accordingly, an alternative way to estimating a model\'s NLU capability is necessary. Recently, analyzing correctness of a model\'s prediction by using Item Response Theory (IRT) framework to estimate such capability is proposed [70], however, we find that it is not clear how it should be applied precisely in our benchmark. As of now, we thus decide to evaluate a model for each task separately without any summarization of overall performance measure. This is our limitation, and we leave this problem for the future.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rapid Saturation of KLUEWe expect fast saturation of KLUE based on our observations of for instance GLUE [94]. However, we do not artificially make our benchmark challenging by e.g. filtering out easy examples for models. Because the main purpose of KLUE is to properly evaluate models in terms of various aspects of NLU, we avoid focusing on enlarging headrooms for improvement over our baseline pretrained language models. We expect our license policy would positively affect the advancement of our benchmark after saturation by collectively developing more challenging tasks with other researchers, such as building the first open-domain question answering for Korean.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Analysis of Korean Language ModelsWe observe various patterns when comparing performances of the baseline models on each tasks, however, most of them are understudied to precisely explain the phenomena. With more thorough investigations, we hope to enhance understanding of the complex interaction of a model, corpus, linguistic properties of Korean and training mechanisms in future work.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 9 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We present KLUE, a suite of Korean NLU benchmarks that includes diverse tasks. We open KLUE to everyone, and we also provide Korean language models trained to outperform multilingual models and other existing open-sourced Korean language models. We set high standards from the outset, as we built the benchmark and trained the models from scratch. We designed the benchmark datasets and trained the annotators rigorously to consider potential ethical issues including private information and hate speech. We documented in detail all of the benchmark construction and testing processes. We also discussed broader impacts and limitations of KLUE and our models. Despite the limitations, KLUE and the accompanying language models will facilitate future Korean NLP research by setting a valuable precedent describing how datasets and language models should be created and spread to a wider community.\n' +
