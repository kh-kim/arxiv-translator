      '## Preface\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For nearly two millenia since Euclid\'s _Elements_, the word \'geometry\' has been synonymous with _Euclidean geometry_, as no other types of geometry existed. Euclid\'s monopoly came to an end in the nineteenth century, with examples of non-Euclidean geometries constructed by Lobachevesky, Bolyai, Gauss, and Riemann. Towards the end of that century, these studies had diverged into disparate fields, with mathematicians and philosophers debating the validity of and relations between these geometries as well as the nature of the "one true geometry".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A way out of this pickle was shown by a young mathematician Felix Klein, appointed in 1872 as professor in the small Bavarian University of Erlangen. In a research prospectus, which entered the annals of mathematics as the _Erlangen Programme_, Klein proposed approaching geometry as the study of _invariants_, i.e. properties unchanged under some class of transformations, called the _symmetries_ of the geometry. This approach created clarity by showing that various geometries known at the time could be defined by an appropriate choice of symmetry transformations, formalized using the language of group theory. For instance, Euclidean geometry is concerned with lengths and angles, because these properties are preserved by the group of Euclidean transformations (rotations and translations), while affine geometry studies parallelism, which is preserved by the group of affine transformations. The relation between these geometries is immediately apparent when considering the respective groups, because the Euclidean group is a subgroup of the affine group, which in turn is a subgroup of the group of projective transformations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The impact of the Erlangen Programme on geometry was very profound. Furthermore, it spilled to other fields, especially physics, where symmetry principles allowed to derive conservation laws from first principles of symmetry (an astonishing result known as Noether\'s Theorem), and even enabled the classification of elementary particles as irreducible representations of the symmetry group. _Category theory_, now pervasive in pure mathematics, can be "regarded as a continuation of the Klein Erlangen Programme, in the sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is generalized to a category with its algebra of mappings", in the words of its creators Samuel Eilenber and Saunders Mac Lane.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'At the time of writing, the state of the field of deep learning is somewhatreminiscent of the field of geometry in the nineteenth century. There is a veritable zoo of neural network architectures for various kinds of data, but few unifying principles. As in times past, this makes it difficult to understand the relations between various methods, inevitably resulting in the reinvention and re-branding of the same concepts in different application domains. For a novice trying to learn the field, absorbing the sheer volume of redundant ideas is a true nightmare.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this text, we make a modest attempt to apply the Erlangen Programme mindset to the domain of deep learning, with the ultimate goal of obtaining a systematisation of this field and \'connecting the dots\'. We call this geometrisation attempt \'Geometric Deep Learning\', and true to the spirit of Felix Klein, propose to derive different inductive biases and network architectures implementing them from first principles of symmetry and invariance. In particular, we focus on a large class of neural networks designed for analysing unstructured sets, grids, graphs, and manifolds, and show that they can be understood in a unified manner as methods that respect the structure and symmetries of these domains.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We believe this text would appeal to a broad audience of deep learning researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts. A novice may use it as an overview and introduction to Geometric Deep Learning. A seasoned deep learning expert may discover new ways of deriving familiar architectures from basic principles and perhaps some surprising connections. Practitioners may get new insights on how to solve problems in their respective fields.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'With such a fast-paced field as modern machine learning, the risk of writing a text like this is that it becomes obsolete and irrelevant before it sees the light of day. Having focused on foundations, our hope is that the key concepts we discuss will transcend their specific realisations -- or, as Claude Adrien Helvetius put it, _"la connaissance de certains principes supplee facilement a la connoissance de certains faits."_\n' +

      '## Chapter 0 Notation\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach - such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding - are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or _feature learning_, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent, typically implemented as _backpropagation_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Exploiting the known symmetries of a large system is a powerful and classical remedy against the curse of dimensionality, and forms the basis of most physical theories. Deep learning systems are no exception, and since the early days researchers have adapted neural networks to exploit the low-dimensional geometry arising from physical measurements, e.g. grids in images, sequences in time-series, or position and momentum in molecules, and their associated symmetries, such as translation or rotation. Throughout our exposition, we will describe these models, as well as many others, as natural instances of the same underlying principle of geometric regularity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Such a \'geometric unification\' endeavour in the spirit of the Erlangen Program serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Before proceeding, it is worth noting that our work concerns _representation learning architectures_ and exploiting the symmetries of data therein. The many exciting _pipelines_ where such representations may be used (such asself-supervised learning, generative modelling, or reinforcement learning) are _not_ our central focus. Hence, we will not review in depth influential neural pipelines such as variational autoencoders (Kingma and Welling, 2013), generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014), normalising flows (Rezende and Mohamed, 2015), deep Q-networks (Mnih et al., 2015), proximal policy optimisation (Schulman et al., 2017), or deep mutual information maximisation (Hjelm et al., 2019). That being said, we believe that the principles we will focus on are of significant importance in all of these areas.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Further, while we have attempted to cast a reasonably wide net in order to illustrate the power of our geometric blueprint, our work does not attempt to accurately summarise the _entire_ existing wealth of research on Geometric Deep Learning. Rather, we study several well-known architectures in-depth in order to demonstrate the principles and ground them in existing research, with the hope that we have left sufficient references for the reader to meaningfully apply these principles to any future geometric deep architecture they encounter or devise.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 2 Learning in High Dimensions\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Supervised machine learning, in its simplest formalisation, considers a set of \\(N\\) observations \\(\\mathcal{D}=\\{(x_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}\\) drawn _i.i.d._ from an underlying data distribution \\(P\\) defined over \\(\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{Y}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) are respectively the data and the label domains. The defining feature in this setup is that \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) is a _high-dimensional space_: one typically assumes \\(\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) to be a Euclidean space of large dimension \\(d\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Let us further assume that the labels \\(y\\) are generated by an unknown function \\(f\\), such that \\(y_{i}=f(x_{i})\\), and the learning problem reduces to estimating the function \\(f\\) using a parametrised function class \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{f_{\\mathbf{\\theta}\\in\\Theta}\\}\\). Neural networks are a common realisation of such parametric function classes, in which case \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}\\in\\Theta\\) corresponds to the network weights. In this idealised setup, there is no noise in the labels, and modern deep learning systems typically operate in the so-called _interpolating regime_, where the estimated \\(\\tilde{f}\\in\\mathcal{F}\\) satisfies \\(\\tilde{f}(x_{i})=f(x_{i})\\) for all \\(i=1,\\ldots,N\\). The performance of a learning algorithm is measured in terms of the _expected performance_ on new samples drawn from \\(P\\), using some _loss_\\(L(\\cdot,\\cdot)\\)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\mathcal{R}(\\tilde{f}):=\\mathbb{E}_{P}\\ L(\\tilde{f}(x),f(x)),\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'with the squared-loss \\(L(y,y^{\\prime})=\\frac{1}{2}|y-y^{\\prime}|^{2}\\) being among the most commonly used ones.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A successful learning scheme thus needs to encode the appropriate notion of regularity or _inductive bias_ for \\(f\\), imposed through the construction of the function class \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) and the use of _regularisation_. We briefly introduce this concept in the following section.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Inductive Bias via Function Regularity\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Modern machine learning operates with large, high-quality datasets, which, together with appropriate computational resources, motivate the design of rich function classes \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) with the capacity to interpolate such large data. This mindset plays well with neural networks, since even the simplest choices of architecture yields a _dense_ class of functions. The capacity to approximate almost arbitrary functions is the subject of various _Universal Approximation Theorems_; several such results were proved and popularised in the 1990s by applied mathematicians and computer scientists (see e.g. Cybenko (1989); Hornik (1991); Barron (1993); Leshno et al. (1993); Maiorov (1999); Pinkus (1999)).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Universal Approximation, however, does not imply an _absence_ of inductive bias. Given a hypothesis space \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) with universal approximation, we can define a complexity measure \\(c:\\mathcal{F}\\to\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\) and redefine our interpolation problem as\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\tilde{f}\\in\\arg\\min_{g\\in\\mathcal{F}}c(g)\\quad\\mathrm{s.t.}\\quad g(x_{i})=f( x_{i})\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\;\\;i=1,\\ldots,N,\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'i.e., we are looking for the most regular functions within our hypothesis class. For standard function spaces, this complexity measure can be defined as a _norm_, making \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) a _Banach space_ and allowing to leverage a plethora of theoretical results in functional analysis. In low dimensions, splines are a workhorse for function approximation. They can be formulated as above, with a norm capturing the classical notion of smoothness, such as the squared-norm of second-derivatives \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}|f^{\\prime\\prime}(x)|^{2}\\mathrm{d}x\\) for cubic splines.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the case of neural networks, the complexity measure \\(c\\) can be expressed in terms of the network weights, i.e. \\(c(f_{\\mathbf{\\theta}})=c(\\mathbf{\\theta})\\). The \\(L_{2}\\)-norm of the network weights, known as _weight decay_, or the so-called _path-norm_(Neyshabur et al., 2015) are popular choices in deep learning literature. From a Bayesian perspective, such complexity measures can also be interpreted as the negative log of the prior for the function of interest. More generally, this complexity can be enforced _explicitly_ by incorporating it into the empirical loss (resulting in the so-called Structural Risk Minimisation), or _implicitly_, as a result of a certain optimisation scheme. For example, it is well-known that gradient-descent on an under-determined least-squares objective will choose interpolating solutions with minimal \\(L_{2}\\) norm. The extension of such implicit regularisation results to modern neural networks is the subject of current studies (see e.g. Blanc et al. (2020); Shamir and Vardi (2020); Razin and Cohen (2020); Gunasekar et al. (2017)). All in all, a natural question arises: how to define effective priors that capture the expected regularities and complexities of real-world prediction tasks?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: Multilayer Perceptrons (Rosenblatt, 1958), the simplest feedforward neural networks, are universal approximators: with just one hidden layer, they can represent combinations of step functions, allowing to approximate any continuous function with arbitrary precision.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### The Curse of Dimensionality\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While interpolation in low-dimensions (with \\(d=1,2\\) or \\(3\\)) is a classic signal processing task with very precise mathematical control of estimation errors using increasingly sophisticated regularity classes (such as spline interpolants, wavelets, curvelets, or ridgelets), the situation for high-dimensional problems is entirely different.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In order to convey the essence of the idea, let us consider a classical notion of regularity that can be easily extended to high dimensions: 1-Lipschitz-functions \\(f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), i.e. functions satisfying \\(|f(x)-f(x^{\\prime})|\\leq\\|x-x^{\\prime}\\|\\) for all \\(x,x^{\\prime}\\in\\mathcal{X}\\). This hypothesis only asks the target function to be _locally_ smooth, i.e., if we perturb the input \\(x\\) slightly (as measured by the norm \\(\\|x-x^{\\prime}\\|\\)), the output \\(f(x)\\) is not allowed to change much. If our only knowledge of the target function \\(f\\) is that it is 1-Lipschitz, how many observations do we expect to require to ensure that our estimate \\(\\tilde{f}\\) will be close to \\(f\\)? Figure 2 reveals that the general answer is necessarily exponential in the dimension \\(d\\), signaling that the Lipschitz class grows \'too quickly\' as the input dimension increases: in many applications with even modest dimension \\(d\\), the number of samples would be bigger than the number of atoms in the universe. The situation is not better if one replaces the Lipschitz class by a global smoothness hypothesis, such as the Sobolev Class \\(\\mathcal{H}^{s}(\\Omega_{d})\\). Indeed, classic results (Tsybakov, 2008) establish a minimax rate of approximation and learning for the Sobolev class of the order \\(\\epsilon^{-d/s}\\), showing that the extra smoothness assumptions on \\(f\\) only improve the statistical picture when \\(s\\propto d\\), an unrealistic assumption in practice.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fully-connected neural networks define function spaces that enable more flexible notions of regularity, obtained by considering complexity functions \\(c\\) on their weights. In particular, by choosing a sparsity-promoting regularisation, they have the ability to break this curse of dimensionality (Bach, 2017). However, this comes at the expense of making strong assumptions on the nature of the target function \\(f\\), such as that \\(f\\) depends on a collection of low-dimensional projections of the input (see Figure 3). In most real-world applications (such as computer vision, speech analysis, physics, or chemistry), functions of interest tend to exhibits complex long-range correlations that cannot be expressed with low-dimensional projections (Figure 3), making this hypothesis unrealistic. It is thus necessary to define an alternative source of regularity, by exploiting the spatial structure of the physical domain and the geometric priors of \\(f\\), as we describe in the next Section 3.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Geometric Priors\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Modern data analysis is synonymous with high-dimensional learning. While the simple arguments of Section 2.1 reveal the impossibility of learning from generic high-dimensional data as a result of the curse of dimensionality, there is hope for physically-structured data, where we can employ two fundamental principles: _symmetry_ and _scale separation_. In the settings considered in this text, this additional structure will usually come from the structure of the domain underlying the input signals: we will assume that our machine learning system operates on _signals_ (functions) on some domain \\(\\Omega\\). While in many cases linear combinations of points on \\(\\Omega\\) is not well-defined, we can linearly combine signals on it, i.e., the space of signals forms a vector space. Moreover, since we can define an inner product between signals, this space is a _Hilbert space_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2: We consider a Lipschitz function \\(f(x)=\\sum_{j=1}^{2^{d}}z_{j}\\phi(x-x_{j})\\) where \\(z_{j}=\\pm 1\\), \\(x_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) is placed in each quadrant, and \\(\\phi\\) a locally supported Lipschitz \'bump’. Unless we observe the function in most of the \\(2^{d}\\) quadrants, we will incur in a constant error in predicting it. This simple geometric argument can be formalised through the notion of _Maximum Discrepancy_(von Luxburg and Bousquet, 2004), defined for the Lipschitz class as \\(\\kappa(d)=\\mathbb{E}_{x,x^{\\prime}}\\sup_{f\\in\\operatorname{Lip}(1)}\\left| \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{l}f(x_{l})-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{l}f(x_{l}^{\\prime})\\right|\\simeq N ^{-1/d}\\), which measures the largest expected discrepancy between two independent \\(N\\)-sample expectations. Ensuring that \\(\\kappa(d)\\simeq\\epsilon\\) requires \\(N=\\Theta(\\epsilon^{-d})\\); the corresponding sample \\(\\{x_{l}\\}_{l}\\) defines an \\(\\epsilon\\)-net of the domain. For a \\(d\\)-dimensional Euclidean domain of diameter \\(1\\), its size grows exponentially as \\(\\epsilon^{-d}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 3: If the unknown function \\(f\\) is presumed to be well approximated as \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\approx g(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x})\\) for some unknown \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{k\\times d}\\) with \\(k\\ll d\\), then shallow neural networks can capture this inductive bias, see e.g. Bach (2017). In typical applications, such dependency on low-dimensional projections is unrealistic, as illustrated in this example: a low-pass filter projects the input images to a low-dimensional subspace; while it conveys most of the semantics, substantial information is lost.\n' +

      '### Symmetries, Representations, and Invariance\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Informally, a _symmetry_ of an object or system is a transformation that leaves a certain property of said object or system unchanged or _invariant_. Such transformations may be either smooth, continuous, or discrete. Symmetries are ubiquitous in many machine learning tasks. For example, in computer vision the object category is unchanged by shifts, so shifts are symmetries in the problem of visual object classification. In computational chemistry, the task of predicting properties of molecules independently of their orientation in space requires _rotational invariance_. Discrete symmetries emerge naturally when describing particle systems where particles do not have canonical ordering and thus can be arbitrarily permuted, as well as in many dynamical systems, via the time-reversal symmetry (such as systems in detailed balance or the Newton\'s second law of motion). As we will see in Section 4.1, permutation symmetries are also central to the analysis of graph-structured data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Symmetry groupsThe set of symmetries of an object satisfies a number of properties. First, symmetries may be combined to obtain new symmetries: if \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\) are two symmetries, then their compositions \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\circ\\mathfrak{h}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\circ\\mathfrak{g}\\) are also symmetries. The reason is that if both transformations leave the object invariant, then so does the composition of transformations, and hence the composition is also a symmetry. Furthermore, symmetries are always invertible, and the inverse is also a symmetry. This shows that the collection of all symmetries form an algebraic object known as a _group_. Since these objects will be a centerpiece of the mathematical model of Geometric Deep Learning, they deserve a formal definition and detailed discussion:A _group_ is a set \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) along with a binary operation \\(\\circ:\\mathfrak{G}\\times\\mathfrak{G}\\to\\mathfrak{G}\\) called _composition_ (for brevity, denoted by juxtaposition \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\circ\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathfrak{gh}\\)) satisfying the following axioms:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Associativity:_\\((\\mathfrak{gh})\\mathfrak{t}=\\mathfrak{g}(\\mathfrak{h}\\mathfrak{t})\\) for all \\(\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{h},\\mathfrak{t}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Identity:_ there exists a unique \\(\\mathfrak{e}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) satisfying \\(\\mathfrak{eq}=\\mathfrak{ge}=\\mathfrak{g}\\) for all \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Inverse:_ For each \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) there is a unique inverse \\(\\mathfrak{g}^{-1}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) such that \\(\\mathfrak{gg}^{-1}=\\mathfrak{g}^{-1}\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{e}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Closure:_ The group is closed under composition, i.e., for every \\(\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{h}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\), we have \\(\\mathfrak{gh}\\ \\in\\mathfrak{G}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that _commutativity_ is not part of this definition, i.e. we may have \\(\\mathfrak{gh}\\neq\\mathfrak{hg}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Groups for which \\(\\mathfrak{gh}=\\mathfrak{hg}\\) for all \\(\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{h}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) are called commutative or _Abelian_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Though some groups can be very large and even infinite, they often arise from compositions of just a few elements, called _group generators_. Formally, \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) is said to be _generated_ by a subset \\(S\\subseteq\\mathfrak{G}\\) (called the group _generator_) if every element \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) can be written as a finite composition of the elements of \\(S\\) and their inverses. For instance, the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle (dihedral group \\(\\mathrm{D}_{3}\\)) is generated by a \\(60^{\\circ}\\) rotation and a reflection (Figure 4). The 1D _translation group_, which we will discuss in detail in the following, is generated by infinitesimal displacements; this is an example of a _Lie group_ of differentiable symmetries.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that here we have defined a group as an abstract object, without saying what the group elements _are_ (e.g. transformations of some domain), only how they _compose_. Hence, very different kinds of objects may have the same symmetry group. For instance, the aforementioned group of rotational and reflection symmetries of a triangle is the same as the group of permutations of a sequence of three elements (we can permute the corners in the triangle in any way using a rotation and reflection - see Figure 4).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Group Actions and Group RepresentationsRather than considering groups as abstract entities, we are mostly interested in how groups _act_ on data. Since we assumed that there is some domain \\(\\Omega\\) underlying our data, we will study how the group acts on \\(\\Omega\\) (e.g. translation of points of the plane), and from there obtain actions of the same group on the space of signals \\(\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\) (e.g. translations of planar images and feature maps).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Technically, what we define here is a _left_ group action. A _group action_ of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) on a set \\(\\Omega\\) is defined as a mapping \\((\\mathfrak{g},u)\\mapsto\\mathfrak{g}.u\\) associating a group element \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) and a point \\(u\\in\\Omega\\) with some other point on \\(\\Omega\\) in a way that is compatible with the group operations, i.e., \\(\\mathfrak{g}.(\\mathfrak{h}.u)=(\\mathfrak{gh}).u\\) for all \\(\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{h}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) and \\(u\\in\\Omega\\). We shall see numerous instances of group actions in the following sections. For example, in the plane the _Euclidean group_\\(\\mathrm{E}(2)\\) is the group of transformations of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) that preserves Euclidean distances, and consists of translations, rotations, and reflections. The same group, however, can also act on the space of _images_ on the plane (by translating, rotating and flipping the grid of pixels), as well as on the representation spaces learned by a neural network. More precisely, if we have a group \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) acting on \\(\\Omega\\), we automatically obtain an action of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) on the space \\(\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\):\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[(\\mathfrak{g}.x)(u)=x(\\mathfrak{g}^{-1}u). \\tag{3}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +

The function \\(f\\) in this case (typically implemented as a Convolutional Neural Network) inputs an image and outputs the probability of the image to contain an object from a certain class (e.g. cat or dog). It is often reasonably assumed that the classification result should not be affected by the position of the object in the image, i.e., the function \\(f\\) must be shift-invariant. Multi-layer Perceptrons, which can approximate any smooth function, do not have this property - one of the reasons why early attempts to apply these architectures to problems of pattern recognition in the 1970s failed.

      '\n' +
      'Subgroups and Levels of structureAs mentioned before, a symmetry is a transformation that preserves some property or structure, and the set of all such transformations for a given structure forms a symmetry group. It happens often that there is not one but multiple structures of interest, and so we can consider several _levels of structure_ on our domain \\(\\Omega\\). Hence, what counts as a symmetry depends on the structure under consideration, but in all cases a symmetry is an invertible map that respects this structure.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On the most basic level, the domain \\(\\Omega\\) is a _set_, which has a minimal amount of structure: all we can say is that the set has some _cardinality_. Self-maps that preserve this structure are _bijections_ (invertible maps), which we may consider as set-level symmetries. One can easily verify that this is a group by checking the axioms: a compositions of two bijections is also a bijection (closure), the associativity stems from the associativity of the function composition, the map \\(\\tau(u)=u\\) is the identity element, and for every \\(\\tau\\) the inverse exists by definition, satisfying \\((\\tau\\circ\\tau^{-1})(u)=(\\tau^{-1}\\circ\\tau)(u)=u\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Depending on the application, there may be further levels of structure. For instance, if \\(\\Omega\\) is a topological space, we can consider maps that preserve _continuity_: such maps are called _homeomorphisms_ and in addition to simple bijections between sets, are also continuous and have continuous inverse. Intuitively, continuous functions are well-behaved and map points in a neighbourhood (open set) around a point \\(u\\) to a neighbourhood around \\(\\tau(u)\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One can further demand that the map and its inverse are (continuously) _differentiable_, i.e., the map and its inverse have a derivative at every point (and the derivative is also continuous). This requires further differentiable structure that comes with differentiable manifolds, where such maps are called _diffeomorphisms_ and denoted by \\(\\operatorname{Diff}(\\Omega)\\). Additional examples of structures we will encounter include _distances_ or _metrics_ (maps preserving them are called _isometries_) or _orientation_ (to the best of our knowledge, orientation-preserving maps do not have a common Greek name).\n' +
      '\n' +

      'The right level of structure to consider depends on the problem. For example, when segmenting histopathology slide images, we may wish to consider flipped versions of an image as equivalent (as the sample can be flipped when put under the microscope), but if we are trying to classify road signs, we would only want to consider orientation-preserving transformations as symmetries (since reflections could change the meaning of the sign).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As we add levels of structure to be preserved, the symmetry group will get smaller. Indeed, adding structure is equivalent to selecting a _subgroup_, which is a subset of the larger group that satisfies the axioms of a group by itself:\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Let \\((\\mathfrak{G},\\circ)\\) be a group and \\(\\mathfrak{H}\\subseteq\\mathfrak{G}\\) a subset. \\(\\mathfrak{H}\\) is said to be a _subgroup_ of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) if \\((\\mathfrak{H},\\circ)\\) constitutes a group with the same operation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For instance, the group of Euclidean isometries \\(\\mathrm{E}(2)\\) is a subgroup of the group of planar diffeomorphisms \\(\\operatorname{Diff}(2)\\), and in turn the group of orientation-preserving isometries \\(\\mathrm{SE}(2)\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\mathrm{E}(2)\\). This hierarchy of structure follows the Erlangen Programme philosophy outlined in the Preface: in Klein\'s construction, the Projective, Affine, and Euclidean geometrieshave increasingly more invariants and correspond to progressively smaller groups.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Isomorphisms and AutomorphismsWe have described symmetries as structure preserving and invertible maps _from an object to itself_. Such maps are also known as _automorphisms_, and describe a way in which an object is equivalent it itself. However, an equally important class of maps are the so-called _isomorphisms_, which exhibit an equivalence between two non-identical objects. These concepts are often conflated, but distinguishing them is necessary to create clarity for our following discussion.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To understand the difference, consider a set \\(\\Omega=\\{0,1,2\\}\\). An automorphism of the set \\(\\Omega\\) is a bijection \\(\\tau:\\Omega\\to\\Omega\\) such as a cyclic shift \\(\\tau(u)=u+1\\mod 3\\). Such a map preserves the cardinality property, and maps \\(\\Omega\\) onto itself. If we have another set \\(\\Omega^{\\prime}=\\{a,b,c\\}\\) with the same number of elements, then a bijection \\(\\eta:\\Omega\\to\\Omega^{\\prime}\\) such as \\(\\eta(0)=a\\), \\(\\eta(1)=b\\), \\(\\eta(2)=c\\) is a _set isomorphism_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As we will see in Section 4.1 for graphs, the notion of structure includes not just the number of nodes, but also the connectivity.

Two isomorphic graphs are thus structurally identical, and differ only in the way their nodes are ordered. On the other hand, a graph automorphism or symmetry is a map \\(\\tau:\\mathcal{V}\\to\\mathcal{V}\\) maps the nodes of the graph back to itself, while preserving the connectivity. A graph with a non-trivial automorphism (i.e., \\(\\tau\\neq\\mathrm{id}\\)) presents symmetries.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The symmetry formalism introduced in Sections 3.1-3.2 captures an idealised world where we know exactly which transformations are to be considered as symmetries, and we want to respect these symmetries _exactly_. For instance in computer vision, we might assume that planar translations are exact symmetries. However, the real world is noisy and this model falls short in two ways.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Firstly, while these simple groups provide a way to understand _global_ symmetries of the domain \\(\\Omega\\) (and by extension, of signals on it, \\(\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\)), they do not capture _local_ symmetries well. For instance, consider a video scene with several objects, each moving along its own different direction. At subsequent frames, the resulting scene will contain approximately the same semantic information, yet no global translation explains the transformation from one frame to another. In other cases, such as a deformable 3D object viewed by a camera, it is simply very hard to describe the group of transformations that preserve the object identity. These examples illustrate that in reality we are more interested in a far larger set of transformations where global, exact invariance is replaced by a local, inexact one. In our discussion, we will distinguish between two scenarios: the setting where the domain \\(\\Omega\\) is fixed, and signals \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\) are undergoing deformations, and the setting where the domain \\(\\Omega\\) itself may be deformed.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Stability to signal deformationsIn many applications, we know a priori that a small deformation of the signal \\(x\\) should not change the output of \\(f(x)\\), so it is tempting to consider such deformations as symmetries. For instance, we could view small diffeomorphisms \\(\\tau\\in\\operatorname{Diff}(\\Omega)\\), or even small bijections, as symmetries. However, small deformations can be composed to form large deformations, so "small deformations" do not form a group, and we cannot ask for invariance or equivariance to small deformations only. Since large deformations can can actually materially change the semantic content of the input, it is not a good idea to use the full group \\(\\operatorname{Diff}(\\Omega)\\) as symmetry group either.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A better approach is to quantify how "far" a given \\(\\tau\\in\\operatorname{Diff}(\\Omega)\\) is from a given symmetry subgroup \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\subset\\operatorname{Diff}(\\Omega)\\) (e.g. translations) with a complexity measure \\(c(\\tau)\\), so that \\(c(\\tau)=0\\) whenever \\(\\tau\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\).

      'Since \\(c(\\tau)=0\\) for \\(\\tau\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\), this definition generalises the \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\)-invariance property defined above. Its utility in applications depends on introducing an appropriate deformation cost. In the case of images defined over a continuous Euclidean plane, a popular choice is \\(c^{2}(\\tau):=\\int_{\\Omega}\\|\\nabla\\tau(u)\\|^{2}\\mathrm{d}u\\), which measures the \'elasticity\' of \\(\\tau\\), i.e., how different it is from the displacement by a constant vector field. This deformation cost is in fact a norm often called the _Dirichlet energy_, and can be used to quantify how far \\(\\tau\\) is from the translation group.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Stability to domain deformationsIn many applications, the object being deformed is not the signal, but the geometric domain \\(\\Omega\\) itself. Canonical instances of this are applications dealing with graphs and manifolds: a graph can model a social network at different instance of time containing slightly different social relations (follow graph), or a manifold can model a 3D object undergoing non-rigid deformations.

Since the Fourier representation diagonalises the shift operator (which can be thought of as convolution, as we will see in more detail in Section 4.2), it is an efficient representation for translation transformations. However, Fourier decompositions are unstable under high-frequency deformations. In contrast, wavelet decompositions offer a stable representation in such cases.\n' +

      'While this reasoning shows that the family of _linear invariants_ is not a very rich object, the family of _linear equivariants_ provides a much more powerful tool, since it enables the construction of rich and stable features by composition with appropriate non-linear maps, as we will now explain.

It is not hard to adapt the standard Universal Approximation Theorems from unstructured vector inputs to show that shallow \'geometric\' networks arealso universal approximators, by properly generalising the group average to a general non-linear invariant. However, as already described in the case of Fourier versus Wavelet invariants, there is a fundamental tension between shallow global invariance and deformation stability. This motivates an alternative representation, which considers instead _localised_ equivariant maps. Assuming that \\(\\Omega\\) is further equipped with a distance metric \\(d\\), we call an equivariant map \\(U\\) localised if \\((Ux)(u)\\) depends only on the values of \\(x(v)\\) for \\(\\mathcal{N}_{u}=\\{v:d(u,v)\\leq r\\}\\), for some small radius \\(r\\); the latter set \\(\\mathcal{N}_{u}\\) is called the _receptive field_.\n' +

A classical instance of the former case is encountered in computer vision applications, where images are assumed to be defined on a fixed domain (grid). Graph classification is an example of the latter setting, where both the structure of the graph as well as the signal defined on it (e.g. node features) are important.

For the purpose of the following discussion, we will further assume the nodes to be endowed with \\(s\\)-dimensional _node features_, denoted by \\(\\mathbf{x}_{u}\\) for all \\(u\\in\\mathcal{V}\\). Social networks are perhaps among the most commonly studied examples of graphs, where nodes represent users, edges correspond to friendship relations between them, and node features model user properties such as age, profile picture, etc. It is also often possible to endow the edges, or entire graphs, with features; but as this does not alter the main findings of this section, we will defer discussing it to future work.\n' +

      'The key structural property of graphs is that the nodes in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) are usually not assumed to be provided in any particular order, and thus any operations performed on graphs should not depend on the ordering of nodes. The desirable property that functions acting on graphs should satisfy is thus _permutation invariance_, and it implies that for any two _isomorphic_ graphs, the outcomes of these functions are identical. We can see this as a particular setting of our blueprint, where the domain \\(\\Omega=\\mathcal{G}\\) and the space \\(\\mathcal{X}(\\mathcal{G},\\mathbb{R}^{d})\\) is that of \\(d\\)-dimensional node-wise signals. The symmetry we consider is given by the _permutation group_\\(\\mathfrak{G}=\\Sigma_{n}\\), whose elements are all the possible orderings of the set of node indices \\(\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Let us first illustrate the concept of permutation invariance on _sets_, a special case of graphs without edges (i.e., \\(\\mathcal{E}=\\emptyset\\)). By stacking the node features as rows of the \\(n\\times d\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}=(\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_{n})^{\\top}\\), we do effectively specify an ordering of the nodes. The action of the permutation \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\in\\Sigma_{n}\\) on the set of nodes amounts to the reordering of the rows of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), which can be represented as an \\(n\\times n\\)_permutation matrix_\\(\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})=\\mathbf{P}\\), where each row and column contains exactly one \\(1\\) and all the other entries are zeros.\n' +

      'Functions like the above provide a \'global\' graph-wise output, but very often, we will be interested in functions that act \'locally\', in a node-wise manner.

If we stack these latent features into a matrix \\(\\mathbf{H}=\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{X})\\) is no longer permutation invariant: the order of the rows of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) should be _tied_ to the order of the rows of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), so that we know which output node feature corresponds to which input node. We need instead a more fine-grained notion of _permutation equivariance_, stating that, once we "commit" to a permutation of inputs, it consistently permutes the resulting objects. Formally, \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{X})\\) is a _permutation equivariant_ function if, for any permutation matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\), it holds that \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{X})=\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{X})\\).

Amongst these generators, our blueprint specifically advocates for those that are also _local_, i.e., whereby the output on node \\(u\\) directly depends on its neighbouring nodes in the graph. We can formalise this constraint explicitly in our model construction, by defining what it means for a node to be neighbouring another.\n' +

As we will see in future work, the choice of \\(\\phi\\) plays a crucial role in the expressive power of such a scheme. When \\(\\phi\\) is injective, it is equivalent to one step of the _Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test_, a classical algorithm in graph theory providing a necessary condition for two graphs to be isomorphic by an iterative color refinement procedure.\n' +

      'It is also worth noticing that the difference between functions defined on sets and more general graphs in this example is that in the latter case we need to explicitly account for the structure of the domain. As a consequence, graphs stand apart in the sense that the domain becomes _part of the input_ in machine learning problems, whereas when dealing with sets and grids (both particular cases of graphs) we can specify only the features and assume the domain to be _fixed_. This distinction will be a recurring motif in our discussion. As a result, the notion of geometric stability (invariance to domain deformation) is crucial in most problems of learning on graphs. It straightforwardly follows from our construction that permutation invariant and equivariant functions produce identical outputs on isomorphic (topologically-equivalent) graphs. These results can be generalised to approximately isomorphic graphs, and several results on stability under graph perturbations exist (Levie et al., 2018).

      'Besides the didactic value of the derivation of the Fourier transform and convolution we have done here, it provides a scheme to generalise these concepts to graphs. Realising that the adjacency matrix of the ring graph is exactly the shift operator, one can can develop the graph Fourier transform and an analogy of the convolution operator by computing the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix (see e.g. Sandryhaila and Moura (2013)). Earlyattempts to develop graph neural networks by analogy to CNNs, sometimes termed\'spectral GNNs\', exploited this exact blueprint. We will see in Sections 4.4-4.6 that this analogy has some important limitations. The first limitation comes from the fact that a grid is fixed, and hence all signals on it can be represented in the same Fourier basis. In contrast, on general graphs, the Fourier basis depends on the structure of the graph. Hence, we cannot directly compare Fourier transforms on two different graphs -- a problem that translated into a lack of generalisation in machine learning problems. Secondly, multi-dimensional grids, which are constructed as tensor products of one-dimensional grids, retain the underlying structure: the Fourier basis elements and the corresponding frequencies (eigenvalues) can be organised in multiple dimensions. In images, for example, we can naturally talk about horizontal and vertical frequency and filters have a notion of _direction_. On graphs, the structure of the Fourier domain is one-dimensional, as we can only organise the Fourier basis functions by the magnitude of the corresponding frequencies. As a result, graph filters are oblivious of direction or _isotropic_.\n' +

      'Derivation of the continuous Fourier transformFor the sake of completeness, and as a segway for the next discussion, we repeat our analysis in the continuous setting.

Moreover, the spectrum of the translation operator is _simple_, meaning that two functions sharing the same eigenvalue must necessarily be collinear.

      'Spherical convolutionNow consider the two-dimensional sphere \\(\\Omega=\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\) with the group of rotations, the _special orthogonal group_\\(\\mathfrak{G}=\\operatorname{SO}(3)\\).

      '\n' +
      'This has important practical consequences: in our Geometric Deep Learning blueprint, we concatenate multiple equivariant maps ("layers" in deep learning jargon) by applying a subsequent operator to the output of the previous one. In the case of translations, we can apply multiple convolutions in sequence, since their outputs are all defined on the same domain \\(\\Omega\\). In the general setting, since \\(x\\star\\theta\\) is a function on \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) rather than on \\(\\Omega\\), we cannot use exactly the same operation subsequently--it means that the next operation has to deal with _signals on \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\)_, i.e. \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\mathfrak{G})\\). Our definition of group convolution allows this case: we take as domain \\(\\Omega=\\mathfrak{G}\\) acted on by \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) itself via the group action \\((\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{h})\\mapsto\\mathfrak{gh}\\) defined by the composition operation of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\). This yields the representation \\(\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})\\) acting on \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\mathfrak{G})\\) by \\((\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})x)(\\mathfrak{h})=x(\\mathfrak{g}^{-1}\\mathfrak{h})\\). The representation of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) acting on functions defined on \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) itself is called the _regular representation_ of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since convolution involves inner product that in turn requires integrating over the domain \\(\\Omega\\), we can only use it on domains \\(\\Omega\\) that are small (in the discrete case) or low-dimensional (in the continuous case). For instance, we can use convolutions on the plane \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) (two dimensional) or special orthogonal group \\(\\mathrm{SE}(3)\\) (three dimensional), or on the finite set of nodes of a graph (\\(n\\)-dimensional), but we cannot in practice perform convolution on the group of permutations \\(\\Sigma_{n}\\), which has \\(n!\\) elements. Likewise, integrating over higher-dimensional groups like the affine group (containing translations, rotations, shearing and scaling, for a total of 6 dimensions) is not feasible in practice. Nevertheless, as we have seen in Section 5.3, we can still build equivariant convolutions for large groups \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) by working with signals defined on low-dimensional spaces \\(\\Omega\\) on which \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) acts. Indeed, it is possible to show that any equivariant linear map \\(f:\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\to\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega^{\\prime})\\) between two domains \\(\\Omega,\\Omega^{\\prime}\\) can be written as a generalised convolution similar to the group convolution discussed here.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Second, we note that the Fourier transform we derived in the previous section from the shift-equivariance property of the convolution can also be extended to a more general case by projecting the signal onto the matrix elements of irreducible representations of the symmetry group.

      'In our last example, the sphere \\(\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\) was a _manifold_, albeit a special one with a global symmetry group due to its homogeneous structure. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the majority of manifolds, which typically do not have global symmetries. In this case, we cannot straightforwardly define an action of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) on the space of signals on \\(\\Omega\\) and use it to\'slide\' filters around in order to define a convolution as a direct generalisation of the classical construction. Nevertheless, manifolds do have two types of invariance that we will explore in this section: transformations preserving metric structure and local reference frame change.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While for many machine learning readers manifolds might appear as somewhat exotic objects, they are in fact very common in various scientific domains. In physics, manifolds play a central role as the model of our Universe -- according to Einstein\'s General Relativity Theory, gravity arises from the curvature of the space-time, modeled as a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. In more \'prosaic\' fields such as computer graphics and vision, manifolds are a common mathematical model of 3D shapes. The broad spectrum of applications of such models ranges from virtual and augmented reality and special effects obtained by means of\'motion capture\' to structural biology dealing with protein interactions that stick together (\'bind\' in chemical jargon) like pieces of 3D puzzle. The common denominator of these applications is the use of a manifold to represent the boundary surface of some 3D object.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'There are several reasons why such models are convenient. First, they offer a compact description of the 3D object, eliminating the need to allocate memory to \'empty space\' as is required in grid-based representations. Second, they allow to ignore the internal structure of the object. This is a handy property for example in structural biology where the internal folding of a protein molecule is often irrelevant for interactions that happen on the molecular surface. Third and most importantly, one often needs to deal with _deformable objects_ that undergo non-rigid deformations. Our own body is one such example, and many applications in computer graphics and vision, such as the aforementioned motion capture and virtual avatars, require _deformation invariance_. Such deformations can be modelled very well as transformationsthat preserve the intrinsic structure of a (Riemannian) manifold, namely the distances between points measured _along_ the manifold, without regard to the way the manifold is embedded in the ambient space.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We should emphasise that manifolds fall under the setting of _varying domains_ in our Geometric Deep Learning blueprint, and in this sense are similar to graphs. We will highlight the importance of the notion of invariance to domain deformations - what we called \'geometric stability\' in Section 3.3. Since differential geometry is perhaps less familiar to the machine learning audience, we will introduce the basic concepts required for our discussion and refer the reader to Penrose (2005) for their detailed exposition.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Riemannian manifoldsSince the formal definition of a manifold is somewhat involved, we prefer to provide an intuitive picture at the expense of some precision. In this context, we can think of a (differentiable or smooth) manifold as a smooth multidimensional curved surface that is _locally Euclidean_, in the sense that any small neighbourhood around any point it can be deformed to a neighbourhood of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{s}\\); in this case the manifold is said to be _\\(s\\)-dimensional_. This allows us to locally approximate the manifold around point \\(u\\) through the _tangent space_\\(T_{u}\\Omega\\). The latter can be visualised by thinking of a prototypical two-dimensional manifold, the sphere, and attaching a plane to it at a point: with sufficient zoom, the spherical surface will seem planar (Figure 11). The collection of all tangent spaces is called the _tangent bundle_, denoted \\(T\\Omega\\); we will dwell on the concept of bundles in more detail in Section 4.5.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A _tangent vector_, which we denote by \\(X\\in T_{u}\\Omega\\), can be thought of as a local displacement from point \\(u\\). In order to measure the _lengths_ of tangent vectors and _angles_ between them, we need to equip the tangent space with additional structure, expressed as a positive-definite bilinear function \\(g_{u}:T_{u}\\Omega\\times T_{u}\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) depending smoothly on \\(u\\). Such a function is called a _Riemannian metric_, in honour of Bernhardt Riemann who introduced the concept in 1856, and can be thought of as an inner product on the tangent space, \\(\\langle X,Y\\rangle_{u}=g_{u}(X,Y)\\), which is an expression of the angle between any two tangent vectors \\(X,Y\\in T_{u}\\Omega\\). The metric also induces a norm \\(\\|X\\|_{u}=g_{u}^{1/2}(X,X)\\) allowing to locally measure lengths of vectors.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We must stress that tangent vectors are abstract geometric entities that exists in their own right and are _coordinate-free_. If we are to express a tangent vector \\(X\\) numerically as an array of numbers, we can only represent it as a list of coordinates \\(\\mathbf{x}=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{s})\\)_relative to some local basis_\\(\\{X_{1},\\ldots X_{s}\\}\\subseteq T_{u}\\Omega\\). Similarly, the metric can be expressed as an \\(s\\times s\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) with elements \\(g_{ij}=g_{u}(X_{i},X_{j})\\) in that basis. We will return to this point in Section 4.5.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A manifold equipped with a metric is called a _Riemannian manifold_ and properties that can be expressed entirely in terms of the metric are said to be _intrinsic_. This is a crucial notion for our discussion, as according to our template, we will be seeking to construct functions acting on signals defined on \\(\\Omega\\) that are invariant to metric-preserving transformations called _isometries_ that deform the manifold without affecting its local structure. If such functions can be expressed in terms of intrinsic quantities, they are automatically guaranteed to be isometry-invariant and thus unaffected by isometric deformations. These results can be further extended to dealing with approximate isometries; this is thus an instance of the geometric stability (domain deformation) discussed in our blueprint.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While, as we noted, the definition of a Riemannian manifold does not require a geometric realisation in any space, it turns out that any smooth Riemannian manifold can be realised as a subset of a Euclidean space of sufficiently high dimension (in which case it is said to be \'embedded\' in that space) by usingthe structure of the Euclidean space to induce a Riemannian metric. Such an embedding is however not necessarily unique - as we will see, two different isometric realisations of a Riemannian metric are possible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Scalar and Vector fieldsSince we are interested in signals defined on \\(\\Omega\\), we need to provide the proper notion of scalar- and vector-valued functions on manifolds. A (smooth) _scalar field_ is a function of the form \\(x:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}\\).

      'Intrinsic gradientAnother way to think of (and actually _define_) vector fields is as a generalised notion of derivative. In classical calculus, one can locally linearise a (smooth) function through the _differential_\\(\\mathrm{d}x(u)=x(u+\\mathrm{d}u)-x(u)\\), which provides the change of the value of the function \\(x\\) at point \\(u\\) as a result of an inifinitesimal displacement \\(\\mathrm{d}u\\). However, in our case the naive use of this definition is impossible, since expressions of the form "\\(u+\\mathrm{d}u\\)" are meaningless on manifolds due to the lack of a global vector space structure.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The solution is to use tangent vectors as a model of local infinitesimal displacement. Given a smooth scalar field \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\), we can think of a (smooth) vector field as a linear map \\(Y:\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\to\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\) satisfying the properties of a _derivation_: \\(Y(c)=0\\) for any constant \\(c\\) (corresponding to the intuition that constant functions have vanishing derivatives), \\(Y(x+z)=Y(x)+Y(z)\\) (linearity), and \\(Y(xz)=Y(x)z+xY(z)\\) (_product_ or _Leibniz rule_), for any smooth scalar fields \\(x,z\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\). It can be shown that one can use these properties to define vector fields axiomatically. The differential \\(\\mathrm{d}x(Y)=Y(x)\\) can be viewed as an operator \\((u,Y)\\mapsto Y(x)\\) and interpreted as follows: the change of \\(x\\) as the result of displacement \\(Y\\in T_{u}\\Omega\\) at point \\(u\\) is given by \\(\\mathrm{d}_{u}x(Y)\\). It is thus an extension of the classical notion of _directional derivative_. Alternatively, at each point \\(u\\) the differential can be regarded as a _linear functional_\\(\\mathrm{d}x_{u}:T_{u}\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) acting on tangent vectors \\(X\\in T_{u}\\Omega\\). Linear functionals on a vector space are called _dual vectors_ or _covectors_; if in addition we are given an inner product (Riemannian metric), a dual vector can always be represented as\n' +

The gradient considered as an _operator_\\(\\nabla:\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\to\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,T\\Omega)\\) assigns at each point \\(x(u)\\mapsto\\nabla x(u)\\in T_{u}\\Omega\\); thus, the gradient of a scalar field \\(x\\) is a vector field \\(\\nabla x\\).\n' +

      'Such curves are called _geodesics_ (from the Greek \\(\\gamma\\)e\\(\\delta\\)x\\(\\alpha\\), literally \'division of Earth\') and they play important role in differential geometry. Crucially to our discussion, the way we defined geodesics is intrinsic, as they depend solely on the Riemannian metric (through the length functional).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Readers familiar with differential geometry might recall that geodesics are a more general concept and their definition in fact does not necessarily require a Riemannian metric but a _connection_ (also called a _covariant derivative_, as it generalises the notion of derivative to vector and tensor fields), which is defined axiomatically, similarly to our construction of the differential. Given a Riemannian metric, there exists a unique special connection called the _Levi-Civita connection_ which is often tacitly assumed in Riemannian geometry. Geodesics arising from this connection are the length-minimising curves we have defined above.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We will show next how to use geodesics to define a way to transport tangent vectors on the manifold (parallel transport), create local intrinsic maps from the manifold to the tangent space (exponential map), and define distances (geodesic metric). This will allow us to construct convolution-like operations by applying a filter locally in the tangent space.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Parallel transportOne issue we have already encountered when dealing with manifolds is that we cannot directly add or subtract two points \\(u,v\\in\\Omega\\). The same problem arises when trying to compare tangent vectors at different points: though they have the same dimension, they belong to _different spaces_, e.g. \\(X\\in T_{u}\\Omega\\) and \\(Y\\in T_{v}\\Omega\\), and thus not directly comparable. Geodesics provide a mechanism to move vectors from one point to another, in the following way: let \\(\\gamma\\) be a geodesic connecting points \\(u=\\gamma(0)\\) and \\(v=\\gamma(T)\\) and let \\(X\\in T_{u}\\Omega\\). We can define a new set of tangent vectors along the geodesic, \\(X(t)\\in T_{\\gamma(t)}\\Omega\\) such that the length of \\(X(t)\\) and the angle (expressed through the Riemannian metric) between it and the velocity vector of the curve is constant,\n' +

Due to the angle and length preservation conditions, parallel transport amounts to only rotation of the vector, so it can be associated with an element of the special orthogonal group \\(\\mathrm{SO}(s)\\) (called the _structure group_ of the tangent bundle), which we will denote by \\(\\mathfrak{g}_{u\\to v}\\) and discuss in further detail in Section 4.5.\n' +

      'Exponential mapLocally around a point \\(u\\), it is always possible to define a unique geodesic in a given direction \\(X\\in T_{u}\\Omega\\), i.e. such that \\(\\gamma(0)=u\\) and \\(\\gamma^{\\prime}(0)=X\\). When \\(\\gamma_{X}(t)\\) is defined for all \\(t\\geq 0\\) (that is, we can shoot the geodesic from a point \\(u\\) for as long as we like), the manifold is said to be _geodesically complete_ and the exponential map is defined on the whole tangent space. Since compact manifolds are geodesically complete, we can tacitly assume this convenient property.\n' +

      'This definition of geodesic provided a point and a direction gives a natural mapping from (a subset of) the tangent space \\(T_{u}\\Omega\\) to \\(\\Omega\\) called the _exponential map_\\(\\exp:B_{r}(0)\\subset T_{u}\\Omega\\to\\Omega\\), which is defined by taking a unit step along the geodesic in the direction \\(X\\), i.e., \\(\\exp_{u}(X)=\\gamma_{X}(1)\\). The exponential map \\(\\exp_{u}\\) is a local diffeomorphism, as it deforms the neighbourhood \\(B_{r}(0)\\) (a ball or radius \\(r\\)) of the origin on \\(T_{u}\\Omega\\) into a neighbourhood of \\(u\\).

An analogy of this operation on the manifold would require parallel transport, allowing to apply a shared \\(\\theta\\), defined as a function on \\(T_{u}\\Omega\\), at some other \\(T_{v}\\Omega\\). However, as we have seen, this in general will depend on the path between \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), so _the way we move the filter around matters_.Third, since we can use the exponential map only locally, the filter must be _local_, with support bounded by the injectivity radius. Fourth and most crucially, we cannot work with \\(\\theta(X)\\), as \\(X\\) is an abstract geometric object: in order for it to be used for computations, we must represent it _relative to some local basis_\\(\\omega_{u}:\\mathbb{R}^{s}\\to T_{u}\\Omega\\), as an \\(s\\)-dimensional array of coordinates \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\omega_{u}^{-1}(X)\\).

      'Yet, this tacitly assumed we can carry the frame \\(\\omega_{u}\\) along to another manifold, i.e. \\(\\omega^{\\prime}_{u}=\\mathrm{d}\\eta_{u}\\circ\\omega_{u}\\). Obtaining such a frame (or _gauge_, in physics terminology) given only a the manifold \\(\\Omega\\) in a consistent manner is however fraught with difficulty. First, a smooth global gauge may not exist: this is the situation on manifolds that are not _parallelisable_, in which case one cannot define a smooth non-vanishing tangent vector field. Second, we do not have a canonical gauge on manifolds, so this choice is arbitrary; since our convolution depends on \\(\\omega\\), if one chose a different one, we would obtain different results.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We should note that this is a case where practice diverges from theory: in practice, it is possible to build frames that are mostly smooth, with a limited number of singularities, e.g. by taking the intrinsic gradient of some intrinsic scalar field on the manifold. Moreover, such constructions are stable, i.e., the frames constructed this way will be identical on isometric manifolds and similar on approximately isometric ones.

      'Nevertheless, this solution is not entirely satisfactory because near singularities, the filter orientation (being defined in a fixed manner relative to the gauge) will vary wildly, leading to a non-smooth feature map even if the input signal and filter are smooth.

Thus, despite _practical_ alternatives, we will look next for a more _theoretically_ well-founded approach that would be altogether independent on the choice of gauge.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The notion of gauge, which we have defined as a frame for the tangent space, is quite a bit more general in physics: it can refer to a frame for any _vector bundle_, not just the tangent bundle. Informally, a vector bundle describes a family of vector spaces parametrised by another space and consists of a _base space_\\(\\Omega\\) with an identical vector space \\(\\mathbb{V}\\) (called the _fibre_) attached to each position \\(u\\in\\Omega\\) (for the tangent bundle these are the tangent spaces\\(T_{u}\\Omega\\)). Roughly speaking, a bundle looks as a product \\(\\Omega\\times\\mathbb{V}\\) locally around \\(u\\), but globally might be \'twisted\' and have an overall different structure. In Geometric Deep Learning, fibres can be used to model the feature spaces at each point in the manifold \\(\\Omega\\), with the dimension of the fibre being equal to the number of feature channels. In this context, a new and fascinating kind of symmetry, called _gauge symmetry_ may present itself.\n' +

Relative to a gauge \\(\\omega\\) for the tangent bundle, \\(X\\) is represented as a function \\(\\mathbf{x}:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}^{s}\\). However it is important to realise that what we are really interested in is the underlying geometrical object (vector field), whose representation as a function \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R}^{s})\\)_depends on the choice of gauge \\(\\omega\\)_.

In other words, a _gauge transformation_ is a mapping \\(\\mathbf{g}:\\Omega\\to\\mathrm{GL}(s)\\), where \\(\\mathrm{GL}(s)\\) is the _general linear group_ of invertible \\(s\\times s\\) matrices. It acts on the gauge \\(\\omega_{u}:\\mathbb{R}^{s}\\to T_{u}\\Omega\\) to produce a new gauge \\(\\omega_{u}^{\\prime}=\\omega_{u}\\circ\\mathbf{g}_{u}:\\mathbb{R}^{s}\\to T_{u}\\Omega\\). The gauge transformation acts on a coordinate vector field at each point via \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}(u)=\\mathbf{g}_{u}^{-1}\\mathbf{x}(u)\\) to produce the coordinate representation \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\) of \\(X\\) relative to the new gauge. The underlying vector field remains unchanged:\n' +

      '\\[X(u)=\\omega_{u}^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}(u))=\\omega_{u}(\\mathbf{g}_{u} \\mathbf{g}_{u}^{-1}\\mathbf{x}(u))=\\omega_{u}(\\mathbf{x}(u))=X(u),\\]\n' +

      'which is exactly the property we desired. More generally, we may have a field of geometric quantities that transform according to a representation \\(\\rho\\) of \\(\\mathrm{GL}(s)\\), e.g. a field of 2-tensors \\((\\)matrices\\()\\)\\(\\mathbf{A}(u)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{s\\times s}\\) that transform like \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}(u)=\\rho_{2}(\\mathbf{g}_{u}^{-1})\\mathbf{A}(u)=\\rho_{1}( \\mathbf{g}_{u})\\mathbf{A}(u)\\rho_{1}(\\mathbf{g}_{u}^{-1})\\).

      'Sometimes we may wish to restrict attention to frames with a certain property, such as orthogonal frames, right-handed frames, etc. Unsurprisingly, we are interested in a set of some property-preserving transformations that form a group. For instance, the group that preserves orthogonality is the orthogonal group \\(\\mathrm{O}(s)\\) (rotations and reflections), and the group that additionally preserves orientation or \'handedness\' is \\(\\mathrm{SO}(s)\\) (pure rotations). Thus, in general we have a group \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) called the _structure group_ of the bundle, and a gauge transformation is a map \\(\\mathfrak{g}:\\Omega\\to\\mathfrak{G}\\). A key observation is that in all cases with the given property, for any two frames at a given point there exists exactly one gauge transformation relating them.\n' +

      'As mentioned before, gauge theory extends beyond tangent bundles, and in general, we can consider a bundle of vector spaces whose structure and dimensions are not necessarily related to those of the base space \\(\\Omega\\). For instance, a color image pixel has a position \\(u\\in\\Omega=\\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\) on a 2D grid and a value \\(\\mathbf{x}(u)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) in the RGB space, so the space of pixels can be viewed as a vector bundle with base space \\(\\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\) and a fibre \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) attached at each point. It is customary to express an RGB image relative to a gauge that has basis vectors for R, G, and B (in that order), so that the coordinate representation of the image looks like \\(\\mathbf{x}(u)=(r(u),g(u),b(u))^{\\top}\\). But we may equally well permute the basis vectors (color channels) independently at each position, as long as we remember the frame (order of channels) in use at each point. As a computational operation this is rather pointless, but as we will see shortly it is conceptually useful to think about gauge transformations for the space of RGB colors, because it allows us to express a gauge symmetry - in this case, an equivalence between colors - and make functions defined on images respect this symmetry (treating each color equivalently).\n' +

      'As in the case of a vector field on a manifold, an RGB gauge transformation changes the numerical representation of an image (permuting the RGB values independently at each pixel) but not the underlying image. In machine learning applications, we are interested in constructing functions \\(f\\in\\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega))\\) on such images (e.g. to perform image classification or segmentation), implemented as layers of a neural network. It follows that if, for whatever reason, we were to apply a gauge transformation to our image, we would need to also change the function \\(f\\) (network layers) so as to preserve their meaning. Consider for simplicity a \\(1\\times 1\\) convolution, i.e. a map that takes an RGB pixel \\(\\mathbf{x}(u)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) to a feature vector \\(\\mathbf{y}(u)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C}\\). According to our Geometric Deep Learning blueprint, the output is associated with a group representation \\(\\rho_{\\text{out}}\\), in this case a \\(C\\)-dimensional representation of the structure group \\(\\mathfrak{G}=\\Sigma_{3}\\) (RGB channel permutations), and similarly the input is associated with a representation \\(\\rho_{\\text{in}}(\\mathfrak{g})=\\mathfrak{g}\\). Then, if we apply a gauge transformation to the input, we would need to change the linear map \\((1\\times 1\\) convolution) \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{C}\\) to \\(f^{\\prime}=\\rho_{\\text{out}}^{-1}(\\mathfrak{g})\\circ f\\circ\\rho_{\\text{in}}( \\mathfrak{g})\\) so that the output feature vector \\(\\mathbf{y}(u)=f(\\mathbf{x}(u))\\) transforms like \\(\\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}(u)=\\rho_{\\text{out}}(\\mathfrak{g}_{u})\\mathbf{y}(u)\\) at every point.

      'Gauge SymmetriesTo say that we consider gauge transformations to be symmetries is to say that any two gauges related by a gauge transformation are to be considered equivalent. For instance, if we take \\(\\mathfrak{G}=\\operatorname{SO}(d)\\), any two right-handed orthogonal frames are considered equivalent, because we can map any such frame to any other such frame by a rotation. In other words, there are no distinguished local directions such as "up" or "right". Similarly, if \\(\\mathfrak{G}=\\operatorname{O}(d)\\) (the orthogonal group), then any left and right handed orthogonal frame are considered equivalent. In this case, there is no preferred orientation either. In general, we can consider a group \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) and a collection of frames at every point \\(u\\) such that for any two of them there is a unique \\(\\mathfrak{g}(u)\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) that maps one frame onto the other.\n' +

      'Regarding gauge transformations as symmetries in our Geometric Deep Learning blueprint, we are interested in making the functions \\(f\\) acting on signals defined on \\(\\Omega\\) and expressed with respect to the gauge should equivariant to such transformation. Concretely, this means that if we apply a gauge transformation to the input, the output should undergo the same transformation (perhaps acting via a different representation of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\)). We noted before that when we change the gauge, the function \\(f\\) should be changed as well, but for a gauge equivariant map this is not the case: changing the gauge leaves the mapping invariant. To see this, consider again the RGB color space example. The map \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{C}\\) is equivariant if \\(f\\circ\\rho_{\\text{in}}(\\mathfrak{g})=\\rho_{\\text{out}}(\\mathfrak{g})\\circ f\\), but in this case the gauge transformation applied to \\(f\\) has no effect: \\(\\rho_{\\text{out}}^{-1}(\\mathfrak{g})\\circ f\\circ\\rho_{\\text{in}}(\\mathfrak{g} )=f\\). In other words, the coordinate expression of a gauge equivariant map is independent of the gauge, in the same way that in the case of graph, we applied the same function regardless of how the input nodes were permuted. However, unlike the case of graphs and other examples covered so far, gauge transformations act _not on_\\(\\Omega\\) but separately _on each of the feature vectors_\\(\\mathbf{x}(u)\\) by a transformation \\(\\mathfrak{g}(u)\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) for each \\(u\\in\\Omega\\).\n' +

      'Further considerations enter the picture when we look at filters on manifolds with a larger spatial support. Let us first consider an easy example of a mapping \\(f:\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\to\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\) from scalar fields to scalar fields on an \\(s\\)-dimensional manifold \\(\\Omega\\). Unlike vectors and other geometric quantities, scalars do not have an orientation, so a scalar field \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\) is _invariant_ to gauge transformations (it transforms according to the trivial representation \\(\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})=1\\)). Hence, any linear map from scalar fields to scalar fields is _gauge equivariant_ (or invariant, which is the same in this case). For example, we could write \\(f\\) similarly to (19), as a convolution-like operation with a position-dependent filter \\(\\theta:\\Omega\\times\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}\\),\n' +
      '\n' +

      'Consider now a more interesting case of a mapping \\(f:\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,T\\Omega)\\to\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,T\\Omega)\\) from vector fields to vector fields.

A general linear map between such functions can be written using the same equation we used for scalars (22), only replacing the scalar kernel by a matrix-valued one \\(\\mathbf{\\Theta}:\\Omega\\times\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}^{s\\times s}\\). The matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\Theta}(u,v)\\) should map tangent vectors in \\(T_{v}\\Omega\\) to tangent vectors in \\(T_{u}\\Omega\\), but these points have _different gauges_ that we may change _arbitrarily and independently_. That is, the filter would have to satisfy \\(\\mathbf{\\Theta}(u,v)=\\rho^{-1}(\\mathfrak{g}(u))\\mathbf{\\Theta}(u,v)\\rho( \\mathfrak{g}(v))\\) for all \\(u,v\\in\\Omega\\), where \\(\\rho\\) denotes the action of \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) on vectors, given by an \\(s\\times s\\) rotation matrix.

      '\n' +
      'We will conclude our discussion of different geometric domains with _geometric graphs_ (i.e., graphs that can be realised in some geometric space) and _meshes_. In our \'5G\' of geometric domains, meshes fall somewhere between graphs and manifolds: in many regards, they are similar to graphs, but their additional structure allows to also treat them similarly to continuous objects. For this reason, we do not consider meshes as a standalone object in our scheme, and in fact, will emphasise that many of the constructions we derive in this section for meshes are directly applicable to general graphs as well.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As we already mentioned in Section 4.4, two-dimensional manifolds (surfaces) are a common way of modelling 3D objects (or, better said, the boundary surfaces of such objects). In computer graphics and vision applications, such surfaces are often discretised as _triangular meshes_, which can be roughly thought of as a piece-wise planar approximation of a surface obtained by gluing triangles together along their edges. Meshes are thus (undirected) _graphs with additional structure_: in addition to nodes and edges, a mesh \\(\\mathcal{T}=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E},\\mathcal{F})\\) also have ordered triplets of nodes forming _triangular faces_\\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{(u,v,q):u,v,q\\in\\mathcal{V}\\text{ and }(u,v),(u,q),(q,v)\\in\\mathcal{E}\\}\\); the order of the nodes defines the face _orientation_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is further assumed that that each edge is shared by exactly two triangles, and the boundary of all triangles incident on each node forms a single loop of edges. This condition guarantees that 1-hop neighbourhoods around each node are disk-like and the mesh thus constitutes a _discrete manifold_ - such meshes are referred to as _manifold meshes_. Similarly to Riemannian manifolds, we can define a _metric_ on the mesh. In the simplest instance, it can be induced from the embedding of the mesh nodes \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_{n}\\) and expressed through the Euclidean length of the edges, \\(\\ell_{uv}=\\|\\mathbf{x}_{u}-\\mathbf{x}_{v}\\|\\). A metric defined in this way automatically satisfies properties such as the _triangle inequality_, i.e., expressions of the form \\(\\ell_{uv}\\leq\\ell_{uq}+\\ell_{vq}\\) for any \\((u,v,q)\\in\\mathcal{F}\\) and any combination of edges. Any property that can be expressed solely in terms of \\(\\ell\\) is _intrinsic_, and any deformation of the mesh preserving \\(\\ell\\) is an _isometry edges_ that belong to exactly one triangle.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Laplacian matricesBy analogy to our treatment of graphs, let us assume a (manifold) mesh with \\(n\\) nodes, each associated with a \\(d\\)-dimensional feature vector, which we can arrange (assuming some arbitrary ordering) into an \\(n\\times d\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). The features can represent the geometric coordinates of the nodes as well as additional properties such as colors, normals, etc, or in specific applications such as chemistry where geometric graphs model molecules, properties such as the atomic number.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Let us first look at the spectral convolution (17) on meshes, which we remind the readers, arises from the Laplacian operator. Considering the mesh as a discretisation of an underlying continuous surface, we can discretise the Laplacian as\n' +

It is easy to see that equation (24) performs local permutation-invariant aggregation of neighbour features \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathcal{N}_{u}})=d_{u}\\mathbf{x}_{u}-\\sum_{ v\\in\\mathcal{N}_{u}}w_{uv}\\mathbf{x}_{v}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{X})=\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}\\mathbf{X}\\) is in fact an instance of our general blueprint (13) for constructing permutation-equivariant functions on graphs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that insofar there is nothing _specific to meshes_ in our definition of Laplacian in (24); in fact, this construction is valid for arbitrary graphs as well, with edge weights identified with the adjacency matrix, \\(\\mathbf{W}=\\mathbf{A}\\), i.e., \\(w_{uv}=1\\) if \\((u,v)\\in\\mathcal{E}\\) and zero otherwise. Laplacians constructed in this way are often called _combinatorial_, to reflect the fact that they merely capture the connectivity structure of the graph. For geometric graphs (which do not necessarily have the additional structure of meshes, but whose nodes do have spatial coordinates that induces a metric in the form of edge lengths), it is common to use weights inversely related to the metric, e.g. \\(w_{uv}\\propto e^{-\\ell_{uv}}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On meshes, we can exploit the additional structure afforded by the faces, and define the edge weights in equation (24) using the _cotangent formula_(Pinkall and Polthier, 1993; Meyer et al., 2003)\n' +

Perhaps the most important property is the convergence of the cotangent mesh Laplacian matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\Delta}\\) to the continuous operator \\(\\Delta\\) when the mesh is infinitely refined (Wardetzky, 2008).

      'Finally, as we already noticed, the definition of the Laplacian (25) is invariant to the permutation of nodes in \\(\\mathcal{N}_{u}\\), as it involves aggregation in the form of summation. While on general graphs this is a necessary evil due to the lack of canonical ordering of neighbours, on meshes we can order the 1-hop neighbours according to some orientation (e.g., clock-wise), and the only ambiguity is the selection of the first node. Thus, instead of any possible permutation we need to account for _cyclic shifts_ (rotations), which intuitively corresponds to the ambiguity arising from \\(\\mathrm{SO}(2)\\) gauge transformationsdiscussed in Section 4.5. For a fixed gauge, it is possible to define an _anisotropic Laplacian_ that is sensitive to local directions and amounts to changing the metric or the weights \\(w_{uv}\\).

However, it appears that the non-Euclidean Fourier transform is extremely sensitive to even minor perturbations of the underlying mesh or graph (see Figure 12 in Section 4.4) and thus can only be used when one has to deal with different signals on a _fixed_ domain, but not when one wishes to generalise across _different domains_. Unluckily, many computer graphics and vision problems fall into the latter category, where one trains a neural network on one set of 3D shapes (meshes) and test on a different set, making the Fourier transform-based approach inappropriate.\n' +

Furthermore, since the Laplacian is local, a polynomial filter of degree \\(r\\) is localised in \\(r\\)-hop neighbourhood.\n' +

      'However, this exact property comes at a disadvantage when dealing with meshes, since the actual support of the filter (i.e., the radius it covers) depends on the _resolution_ of the mesh.

A crucial difference compared to the direct computation of the Fourier transform is that polynomial and rational filters are stable under approximate isometric deformations of the underlying graph or mesh - various results of this kind were shown e.g. by Levie et al.

      'Meshes as operators and Functional mapsThe paradigm of functional maps suggests thinking of meshes as _operators_. As we will show, this allows obtaining more interesting types of invariance exploiting the additional structure of meshes. For the purpose of our discussion, assume the mesh \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is constructed upon embedded nodes with coordinates \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). If we construct an intrinsic operator like the Laplacian, it can be shown that it encodes completely the structure of the mesh, and one can recover the mesh (up to its isometric embedding, as shown by Zeng et al. (2012)). This is also true for some other operators (see e.g. Boscaini et al. (2015); Corman et al. (2017); Chern et al. (2018)), so we will assume a general operator, or \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{Q}(\\mathcal{T},\\mathbf{X})\\), as a representation of our mesh.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this view, the discussion of Section 4.1 of learning functions of the form \\(f(\\mathbf{X},\\mathcal{T})\\) can be rephrased as learning functions of the form \\(f(\\mathbf{Q})\\). Similar to graphs and sets, the nodes of meshes also have no canonical ordering, i.e., functions on meshes must satisfy the permutation invariance or equivariance conditions,\n' +

      'for any permutation matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\). However, compared to general graphs we now have more structure: we can assume that our mesh arises from the discretisation of some underlying continuous surface \\(\\Omega\\). It is thus possible to have a different mesh \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}=(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime},\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime},\\mathcal{F}^ {\\prime})\\) with \\(n^{\\prime}\\) nodes and coordinates \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\) representing the same object \\(\\Omega\\) as \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Importantly, the meshes \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}\\) can have a different connectivity structure and even different number of nodes (\\(n^{\\prime}\\neq n\\)). Therefore, we cannot think of these meshes as isomorphic graphs with mere reordering of nodes and consider the permutation matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) as correspondence between them.\n' +

      'Having thoroughly studied various instantiations of our Geometric Deep Learning blueprint (for different choices of domain, symmetry group, and notions of locality), we are ready to discuss how enforcing these prescriptions can yield some of the most popular deep learning architectures.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our exposition, once again, will not be in strict order of generality. We initially cover three architectures for which the implementation follows nearly-directly from our preceding discussion: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), group-equivariant CNNs, and graph neural networks (GNNs).\n' +

      'We will then take a closer look into variants of GNNs for cases where a graph structure is not known upfront (i.e. unordered sets), and through our discussion we will describe the popular Deep Sets and Transformer architectures as instances of GNNs.\n' +

      'Following our discussion on geometric graphs and meshes, we first describe equivariant message passing networks, which introduce explicit geometric symmetries into GNN computations. Then, we show ways in which our theory of geodesics and gauge symmetries can be materialised within deep learning, recovering a family of intrinsic mesh CNNs (including Geodesic CNNs, MoNet and gauge-equivariant mesh CNNs).\n' +

      'Lastly, we look back on the grid domain from a _temporal_ angle. This discussion will lead us to recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

      '\n' +
      'Convolutional Neural Networks are perhaps the earliest and most well known example of deep learning architectures following the blueprint of Geometric Deep Learning outlined in Section 3.5. In Section 4.2 we have fully characterised the class of linear and local translation equivariant operators, given by convolutions \\(\\mathbf{C}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{x}\\star\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) with a localised filter \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). Let us first focus on scalar-valued (\'single-channel\' or \'grayscale\') discretised images, where the domain is the grid \\(\\Omega=[H]\\times[W]\\) with \\(\\mathbf{u}=(u_{1},u_{2})\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R})\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Any convolution with a compactly supported filter of size \\(H^{f}\\times W^{f}\\) can be written as a linear combination of generators \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1,1},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{H^{f},W^{f}}\\), given for example by the unit peaks \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{vw}(u_{1},u_{2})=\\delta(u_{1}-v,u_{2}-w)\\). Any local linear equivariant map is thus expressible as\n' +

      'Figure 14: The process of convolving an image \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) with a filter \\(\\mathbf{C}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\). The filter parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) can be expressed as a linear combination of generators \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{vw}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Other choices of the basis \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}_{vw}\\) are also possible and will yield equivalent operations (for potentially different choices of \\(\\alpha_{vw}\\)). A popular example are _directional derivatives_: \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}_{vw}(u_{1},u_{2})=\\delta(u_{1},u_{2})-\\delta(u_{1}-v,u_{2}-w),(v,w) \\neq(0,0)\\) taken together with the local average \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}_{0}(u_{1},u_{2})=\\frac{1}{H_{f}W_{f}}\\). In fact, directional derivatives can be considered a grid-specific analogue of diffusion processes on graphs, which we recover if we assume each pixel to be a node connected to its immediate neighbouring pixels in the grid.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'When the scalar input channel is replaced by multiple channels (e.g., RGB colours, or more generally an arbitrary number of _feature maps_), the convolutional filter becomes a _convolutional tensor_ expressing arbitrary linear combinations of input features into output feature maps.

      '\n' +
      'where \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are respectively the number of input and output channels. This basic operation encompasses a broad class of neural network architectures, which, as we will show in the next section, have had a profound impact across many areas of computer vision, signal processing, and beyond. Here, rather than dissecting the myriad of possible architectural variants of CNNs, we prefer to focus on some of the essential innovations that enabled their widespread use.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Efficient multiscale computationAs discussed in the GDL template for general symmetries, extracting translation invariant features out of the convolutional operator \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) requires a non-linear step. Convolutional features are processed through a non-linear _activation function_\\(\\sigma\\), acting element-wise on the input--i.e., \\(\\sigma:\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\rightarrow\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\), as \\(\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})(u)=\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}(u))\\). Perhaps the most popular example at the time of writing is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): \\(\\sigma(x)=\\max(x,0)\\). This non-linearity effectively _rectifies_ the signals, pushing their energy towards lower frequencies, and enabling the computation of high-order interactions across scales by iterating the construction.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Already in the early works of Fukushima and Miyake (1982) and LeCun et al. (1998), CNNs and similar architectures had a multiscale structure, where after each convolutional layer (28) one performs a grid coarsening \\(\\mathbf{P}:\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\rightarrow\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega^{\\prime})\\), where the grid \\(\\Omega^{\\prime}\\) has coarser resolution than \\(\\Omega\\). This enablesmultiscale filters with effectively increasing receptive field, yet retaining a constant number of parameters per scale. Several signal coarsening strategies \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) (referred to as _pooling_) may be used, the most common are applying a low-pass anti-aliasing filter (e.g. local average) followed by grid downsampling, or non-linear max-pooling.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In summary, a \'vanilla\' CNN layer can be expressed as the composition of the basic objects already introduced in our Geometric Deep Learning blueprint:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\mathbf{h}=\\mathbf{P}(\\sigma(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})))\\, \\tag{29}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'i.e. an equivariant linear layer \\(\\mathbf{F}\\), a coarsening operation \\(\\mathbf{P}\\), and a non-linearity \\(\\sigma\\). It is also possible to perform translation invariant _global_ pooling operations within CNNs. Intuitively, this involves each pixel--which, after several convolutions, summarises a _patch_ centered around it--_proposing_ the final representation of the image, with the ultimate choice being guided by a form of aggregation of these proposals. A popular choice here is the average function, as its outputs will retain similar magnitudes irrespective of the image size (Springenberg et al., 2014).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Prominent examples following this CNN blueprint (some of which we will discuss next) are displayed in Figure 15.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Deep and Residual NetworksA CNN architecture, in its simplest form, is therefore specified by hyperparameters \\((H_{k}^{f},W_{k}^{f},N_{k},p_{k})_{k\\leq K}\\), with \\(M_{k+1}=N_{k}\\) and \\(p_{k}=0,1\\) indicating whether grid coarsening is performed or not. While all these hyperparameters are important in practice, a particularly important question is to understand the role of depth \\(K\\) in CNN architectures, and what are the fundamental tradeoffs involved in choosing such a key hyperparameter, especially in relation to the filter sizes \\((H_{k}^{f},W_{k}^{f})\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While a rigorous answer to this question is still elusive, mounting empirical evidence collected throughout the recent years suggests a favourable tradeoff towards deeper (large \\(K\\)) yet thinner (small \\((H_{k}^{f},W_{k}^{f})\\)) models. In this context, a crucial insight by He et al. (2016) was to reparametrise each convolutional layer to model a _perturbation_ of the previous features, rather than a generic non-linear transformation:\n' +

In essence, the residual parametrisation is consistent Figure 15: Prominent examples of CNN architectures. **Top-to-bottom**: LeNet (LeCun et al., 1998), AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), ResNet (He et al., 2016) and U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015).

      'with the view that the deep network is a discretisation of an underlying continuous dynamical system, modelled as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Crucially, learning a dynamical system by modeling its velocity turns out to be much easier than learning its position directly. In our learning setup, this translates into an optimisation landscape with more favorable geometry, leading to the ability to train much deeper architectures than was possible before. As will be discussed in future work, learning using deep neural networks defines a non-convex optimisation problem, which can be efficiently solved using gradient-descent methods under certain simplifying regimes. The key advantage of the ResNet parametrisation has been rigorously analysed in simple scenarios (Hardt and Ma, 2016), and remains an active area of theoretical investigation. Finally, Neural ODEs (Chen et al., 2018) are a recent popular architecture that pushes the analogy with ODEs even further, by learning the parameters of the ODE \\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\sigma(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}))\\) directly and relying on standard numerical integration.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'NormalisationAnother important algorithmic innovation that boosted the empirical performance of CNNs significantly is the notion of _normalisation_. In early models of neural activity, it was hypothesised that neurons perform some form of local \'gain control\', where the layer coefficients \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\) are replaced by \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{k}=\\sigma_{k}^{-1}\\odot(\\mathbf{x}_{k}-\\mu_{k})\\). Here, \\(\\mu_{k}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{k}\\) encode the first and second-order moment information of \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\), respectively. Further, they can be either computed globally or locally.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the context of Deep Learning, this principle was widely adopted through the _batch normalisation_ layer (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), followed by several variants (Ba et al., 2016; Salimans and Kingma, 2016; Ulyanov et al., 2016; Cooijmans et al., 2016; Wu and He, 2018). Despite some attempts to rigorously explain the benefits of normalisation in terms of better conditioned optimisation landscapes (Santurkar et al., 2018), a general theory that can provide guiding principles is still missing at the time of writing.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Data augmentationWhile CNNs encode the geometric priors associated with translation invariance and scale separation, they do not explicitly account for other known transformations that preserve semantic information, e.g lightning or color changes, or small rotations and dilations. A pragmatic approach to incorporate these priors with minimal architectural changes is to perform _data augmentation_, where one manually performs said transformations to the input images and adds them into the training set.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Data augmentation has been empirically successful and is widely used--not only to train state-of-the-art vision architectures, but also to prop up several developments in self-supervised and causal representation learning (Chen et al., 2020; Grill et al., 2020; Mitrovic et al., 2020). However, it is provably sub-optimal in terms of sample complexity (Mei et al., 2021); a more efficient strategy considers instead architectures with richer invariance groups--as we discuss next.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'As discussed in Section 4.3, we can generalise the convolution operation from signals on a Euclidean space to signals on any _homogeneous space_\\(\\Omega\\) acted upon by a group \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\). By analogy to the Euclidean convolution where a _translated_ filter is matched with the signal, the idea of group convolution is to move the filter around the domain using the group action, e.g. by rotating and translating. By virtue of the _transitivity_ of the group action, we can move the filter to any position on \\(\\Omega\\). In this section, we will discuss several concrete examples of the general idea of group convolution, including implementation aspects and architectural choices.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Discrete group convolutionWe begin by considering the case where the domain \\(\\Omega\\) as well as the group \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\) are discrete. As our first example, we consider medical volumetric images represented as signals of on 3D grids with discrete translation and rotation symmetries. The domain is the 3D cubical grid \\(\\Omega=\\mathbb{Z}^{3}\\) and the images (e.g. MRI or CT 3D scans) are modelled as functions \\(x:\\mathbb{Z}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), i.e. \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}(\\Omega)\\). Although in practice such images have support on a finite cuboid \\([W]\\times[H]\\times[D]\\subset\\mathbb{Z}^{3}\\), we instead prefer to view them as functions on \\(\\mathbb{Z}^{3}\\) with appropriate zero padding. As our symmetry, we consider the group \\(\\mathfrak{G}=\\mathbb{Z}^{3}\\rtimes O_{h}\\) of distance- and orientation-preserving transformations on \\(\\mathbb{Z}^{3}\\). This group consists of translations \\((\\mathbb{Z}^{3})\\) and the discrete rotations \\(O_{h}\\) generated by \\(90\\) degree rotations about the three axes (see Figure 16).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As our second example, we consider DNA sequences made up of four letters: C, G, A, and T. The sequences can be represented on the 1D grid \\(\\Omega=\\mathbb{Z}\\) as signals \\(x:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\), where each letter is one-hot coded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{4}\\). Naturally, we have a discrete 1D translation symmetry on the grid, but DNA sequences have an additional interesting symmetry. This symmetry arises from the way DNA is physically embodied as a double helix, and the way it is read by the molecular machinery of the cell. Each strand of the double helix begins with what is called the \\(5^{\\prime}\\)-end and ends with a \\(3^{\\prime}\\)-end, with the \\(5^{\\prime}\\) on one strand complemented by a \\(3^{\\prime}\\) on the other strand. In other words, the two strands have an opposite orientation. Since the DNA molecule is always read off starting at the \\(5^{\\prime}\\)-end, but we do not know which one, a sequence such as ACCCTGG is equivalent to the reversed sequence with each letter replaced by its complement, CCAGGGT. This is called _reverse-complement symmetry_ of the letter sequence. We thus have the two-element group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{2}=\\{0,1\\}\\) corresponding to the identity \\(0\\) and reverse-complement transformation \\(1\\) (and composition \\(1+1=0\\mod 2\\)). The full group combines translations and reverse-complement transformations.\n' +

      'Transform+Convolve approachWe will show that the group convolution can be implemented in two steps: a filter transformation step, and a translational convolution step. The filter transformation step consists of creating rotated (or reverse-complement transformed) copies of a basic filter, while the translational convolution is the same as in standard CNNs and thus efficiently computable on hardware such as GPUs. To see this, note that in both of our examples we can write a general transformation \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\in\\mathfrak{G}\\) as a transformation \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\in\\mathfrak{H}\\) (e.g. a rotation or reverse-complement transformation) followed by a translation \\(\\mathfrak{k}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{d}\\), i.e. \\(\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{h}\\mathfrak{h}\\) (with juxtaposition denoting the composition of the group elements \\(\\mathfrak{k}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\)). By properties of the group representation, we have \\(\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})=\\rho(\\mathfrak{h}\\mathfrak{h})=\\rho(\\mathfrak{k})\\rho( \\mathfrak{h})\\). Thus,\n' +

      'We recognise the last equation as the standard (planar Euclidean) convolution of the signal \\(x\\) and the transformed filter \\(\\rho(\\mathfrak{h})\\theta\\).

For both of our examples, the symmetries act on filters by simply permuting the filter coefficients, as shown in Figure 16 for discrete rotations. Hence, these operations can be implemented efficiently using an indexing operation with pre-computed indices.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While we defined the feature maps output by the group convolution \\(x\\star\\theta\\) as functions on \\(\\mathfrak{G}\\), the fact that we can split \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) into \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{k}\\) means that we can also think of them as a stack of Euclidean feature maps (sometimes called _orientation channels_), with one feature map per filter transformation / orientation \\(\\mathfrak{k}\\). For instance, in our first example we would associate to each filter rotation (each node in Figure 16) a feature map, which is obtained by convolving (in the traditional translational sense) the rotated filter. These feature maps can thus still be stored as a \\(W\\times H\\times C\\) array, where the number of channels \\(C\\) equals the number of independent filters times the number of transformations \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\in\\mathfrak{H}\\) (e.g. rotations).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Section 4.3, the group convolution is equivariant: \\((\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})x)\\star\\theta=\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})(x\\star\\theta)\\). What this means in terms of orientation channels is that under the action of \\(\\mathfrak{h}\\), each orientation channel is transformed, and the orientation channels themselves are permuted. For instance, if we associate one orientation channel per transformation in Figure 16 and apply a rotation by \\(90\\) degrees about the z-axis (corresponding to the red arrows), the feature maps will be permuted as shown by the red arrows. This description makes it clear that a group convolutional neural network bears much similarity to a traditional CNN. Hence, many of the network design patterns discussed in the Section 5.1, such as residual networks, can be used with group convolutions as well.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Spherical CNNs in the Fourier domainFor the continuous symmetry group of the sphere that we saw in Section 4.3, it is possible to implement the convolution in the spectral domain, using the appropriate Fourier transform (we remind the reader that the convolution on \\(\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\) is a function on \\(\\mathrm{SO}(3)\\), hence we need to define the Fourier transform on both these domains in order to implement multi-layer spherical CNNs). _Spherical harmonics_ are an orthogonal basis on the 2D sphere, analogous to the classical Fourier basis of complex exponential. On the special orthogonal group, the Fourier basis is known as the _Wigner D-functions_. In both cases, the Fourier transforms (coefficients) are computed as the inner product with the basis functions, and an analogy of the Convolution Theorem holds: one can compute the convolution in the Fourier domain as the element-wise product of the Fourier transforms. Furthermore, FFT-like algorithms exist for the efficient computation of Fourier transform on \\(\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{SO}(3)\\). We refer for further details to Cohen et al. (2018).\n' +

      'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the realisation of our Geometric Deep Learning blueprint on graphs leveraging the properties of the permutation group. GNNs are among the most general class of deep learning architectures currently in existence, and as we will see in this text, most other deep learning architectures can be understood as a special case of the GNN with additional geometric structure.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As per our discussion in Section 4.1, we consider a graph to be specified with an adjacency matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and node features \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). We will study GNN architectures that are _permutation equivariant_ functions \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{A})\\) constructed by applying shared _permutation invariant_ functions \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathcal{N}_{u}})\\) over local neighbourhoods. Under various guises, this local function \\(\\phi\\) can be referred to as "diffusion", "propagation", or "message passing", and the overall computation of such \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) as a "GNN layer".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The design and study of GNN layers is one of the most active areas of deep learning at the time of writing, making it a landscape that is challenging to navigate. Fortunately, we find that the vast majority of the literature may be derived from only three "flavours" of GNN layers (Figure 17), which we will present here. These flavours govern the extent to which \\(\\phi\\) transforms the neighbourhood features, allowing for varying degrees of complexity when modelling interactions across the graph.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In all three flavours, permutation invariance is ensured by _aggregating_ features from \\(\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathcal{N}_{u}}\\) (potentially transformed, by means of some function \\(\\psi\\)) with some permutation-invariant function \\(\\bigoplus\\), and then _updating_ the features of node \\(u\\), by means of some function \\(\\phi\\). Typically, \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are learnable, whereas \\(\\bigoplus\\) is realised as a nonparametric operation such as sum, mean, or maximum, though it can also be constructed e.g. using recurrent neural networks (Murphy et al., 2018).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 17: A visualisation of the dataflow for the three flavours of GNN layers, \\(g\\). We use the neighbourhood of node \\(b\\) from Figure 10 to illustrate this. Left-to-right: **convolutional**, where sender node features are multiplied with a constant, \\(c_{uv}\\); **attentional**, where this multiplier is _implicitly_ computed via an attention mechanism of the receiver over the sender: \\(\\alpha_{uv}=a(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{x}_{v})\\); and **message-passing**, where vector-based messages are computed based on both the sender and receiver: \\(\\mathbf{m}_{uv}=\\psi(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{x}_{v})\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the **convolutional** flavour (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Defferrard et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2019), the features of the neighbourhood nodes are directly aggregated with fixed weights,\n' +

      'Here, \\(c_{uv}\\) specifies the _importance_ of node \\(v\\) to node \\(u\\)\'s representation. It is a constant that often directly depends on the entries in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) representing the structure of the graph. Note that when the aggregation operator \\(\\bigoplus\\) is chosen to be the summation, it can be considered as a linear diffusion or position-dependent linear filtering, a generalisation of convolution. In particular, the spectral filters we have seen in Sections 4.4 and 4.6 fall under this category, as they amount to applying fixed local operators (e.g. the Laplacian matrix) to node-wise signals.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the **attentional** flavour (Velickovic et al., 2018; Monti et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), the interactions are implicit\n' +

They are often softmax-normalised across all neighbours.

      '\n' +
      'Finally, the **message-passing** flavour (Gilmer et al., 2017; Battaglia et al., 2018) amounts to computing arbitrary vectors ("messages") across edges,\n' +

      '\n' +
      'One important thing to note is a representational containment between these approaches: _convolution \\(\\subseteq\\) attention \\(\\subseteq\\) message-passing_. Indeed, attentional GNNs can represent convolutional GNNs by an attention mechanism implemented as a look-up table \\(a(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{x}_{v})=c_{uv}\\), and both convolutional and attentional GNNs are special cases of message-passing where the messages are only the sender nodes\' features: \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{x}_{v})=c_{uv}\\psi(\\mathbf{x}_{v})\\) for convolutional GNNs and \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{x}_{v})=a(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{x}_{v})\\psi( \\mathbf{x}_{v})\\) for attentional GNNs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This does not imply that message passing GNNs are always the most useful variant; as they have to compute vector-valued messages across edges, they are typically harder to train and require unwieldy amounts of memory. Further, on a wide range of naturally-occurring graphs, the graph\'s edges encode for downstream class similarity (i.e. an edge \\((u,v)\\) implies that \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are likely to have the same output). For such graphs (often called _homophilous_), convolutional aggregation across neighbourhoods is often a far better choice, both in terms of regularisation and scalability. Attentional GNNs offer a "middle-ground": they allow for modelling complex interactions within neighbourhoods while computing only scalar-valued quantities across the edges, making them more scalable than message-passing.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The "three flavour" categorisation presented here is provided with brevity in mind and inevitably neglects a wealth of nuances, insights, generalisations, and historical contexts to GNN models. Importantly, it excludes higher-dimensional GNN based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman hierarchy and spectral GNNs relying on the explicit computation of the graph Fourier transform.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Deep Sets, Transformers, and Latent Graph Inference\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We close the discussion on GNNs by remarking on permutation-equivariant neural network architectures for learning representations of _unordered sets_. While sets have the least structure among the domains we have discussed in this text, their importance has been recently highlighted by highly-popular architectures such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and Deep Sets (Zaheer et al., 2017). In the language of Section 4.1, we assume that we are given a matrix of node features, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), but without any specified adjacency or ordering information between the nodes. The specific architectures will arise by deciding to what extent to model _interactions_ between the nodes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Empty edge setUnordered sets are provided without any additional structure or geometry whatsoever--hence, it could be argued that the most natural way to process them is to treat each set element entirely _independently_. This translates to a permutation equivariant function over such inputs, which was already introduced in Section 4.1: a shared transformation applied to every node in isolation. Assuming the same notation as when describing GNNs (Section 5.3), such models can be represented as\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\mathbf{h}_{u}=\\psi(\\mathbf{x}_{u}),\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(\\psi\\) is a learnable transformation. It may be observed that this is a special case of a convolutional GNN with \\(\\mathcal{N}_{u}=\\{u\\}\\)--or, equivalently, \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{I}\\). Such an architecture is commonly referred to as Deep Sets, in recognition of the work of Zaheer et al. (2017) that have theoretically proved several universal-approximation properties of such architectures. It should be noted that the need to process unordered sets commonly arises in computer vision and graphics when dealing with _point clouds_; therein, such models are known as PointNets (Qi et al., 2017).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Complete edge setWhile assuming an empty edge set is a very efficient construct for building functions over unordered sets, often we would expect that elements of the set exhibit some form of relational structure--i.e., that there exists a _latent graph_ between the nodes. Setting \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{I}\\) discards any such structure, and may yield suboptimal performance. Conversely, we could assume that, in absence of any other prior knowledge, we cannot upfront exclude _any_ possible links between nodes. In this approach we assume the _complete_ graph, \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\); equivalently, \\(\\mathcal{N}_{u}=\\mathcal{V}\\). As we do not assume access to any coefficients of interaction, running _convolutional_-type GNNs over such a graph would amount to:\n' +

      'where the second input, \\(\\bigoplus_{v\\in\\mathcal{V}}\\psi(\\mathbf{x}_{v})\\) is _identical_ for all nodes \\(u\\), and as such makes the model equivalently expressive to ignoring that input altogether; i.e. the \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{I}\\) case mentioned above.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This motivates the use of a more expressive GNN flavour, the _attentional_,\n' +

      '\n' +
      'which yields the _self-attention_ operator, the core of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Assuming some kind of normalisation over the attentional coefficients (e.g. softmax), we can constrain all the scalars \\(a(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{x}_{v})\\) to be in the range \\([0,1]\\); as such, we can think of self-attention as inferring a _soft adjacency matrix_, \\(a_{uv}=a(\\mathbf{x}_{u},\\mathbf{x}_{v})\\), as a byproduct of gradient-based optimisation for some downstream task.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is also appropriate to apply the message-passing flavour.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While popular for physics simulations and relational reasoning (e.g. Battaglia et al. (2016); Santoro et al. (2017)), they have not been as widely used as Transformers. This is likely due to the memory issues associated with computing vector messages over a complete graph, or the fact that vector-based messages are less interpretable than the "soft adjacency" provided by self-attention.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On graphs, where no natural ordering of nodes exists, multiple alternatives were proposed to such positional encodings. While we defer discussing these alternatives for later, we note that one promising direction involves a realisation that the positional encodings used in Transformers can be directly related to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and hence to the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian of a "circular grid". Hence, Transformers\' positional encodings are implicitly representing our assumption that input nodes are connected in a grid. For more general graph structures, one may simply use the Laplacian eigenvectors of the (assumed) graph--an observation exploited by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) within their empirically powerful Graph Transformer model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Inferred edge setFinally, one can try to learn the latent relational structure, leading to some general \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) that is neither \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) nor \\(\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\). The problem of inferring a latent adjacency matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) for a GNN to use (often called _latent graph inference_) is of high interest for graph representation learning. This is due to the fact that assuming \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{I}\\) may be representationally inferior, and \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^{\\top}\\) may be challenging to implement due to memory requirements and large neighbourhoods to aggregate over. Additionally, it is closest to the "true" problem: inferring an adjacency matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) implies detecting useful structure between the rows of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), which may then help formulate hypotheses such as causal relations between variables.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Unfortunately, such a framing necessarily induces a step-up in modelling complexity. Specifically, it requires properly balancing a structure learning objective (which is _discrete_, and hence challenging for gradient-based optimisation) with any downstream task the graph is used for. This makes latent graph inference a highly challenging and intricate problem.\n' +

      '### 5.5 Equivariant Message Passing Networks\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In many applications of Graph Neural Networks, node features (or parts thereof) are not just arbitrary vectors but _coordinates_ of geometric entities. This is the case, for example, when dealing with molecular graphs: the nodes representing atoms may contain information about the atom type as well as its 3D spatial coordinates. It is desirable to process the latter part of the features in a manner that would transform in the same way as the molecule is transformed in space, in other words, be equivariant to the Euclidean group \\(\\mathrm{E}(3)\\) of rigid motions (rotations, translations, and reflections) in addition to the standard permutation equivariance discussed before.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To set the stage for our (slightly simplified) analysis, we will make a distinction between node _features_\\(\\mathbf{f}_{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) and node _spatial coordinates_\\(\\mathbf{x}_{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\); the latter are endowed with Euclidean symmetry structure. In this setting, an equivariant layer explicitly transforms these two inputs separately, yielding modified node features \\(\\mathbf{f}_{u}^{\\prime}\\) and coordinates \\(\\mathbf{x}_{u}^{\\prime}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We can now state our desirable equivariance property, following the Geometric Deep Learning blueprint. If the spatial component of the input is transformed by \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\in\\mathrm{E}(3)\\) (represented as \\(\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{b}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is an orthogonal matrix modeling rotations and reflections, and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a translation vector), the spatial component of the output transforms in the same way (as \\(\\mathbf{x}_{u}^{\\prime}\\mapsto\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{x}_{u}^{\\prime}+\\mathbf{b}\\)), whereas \\(\\mathbf{f}_{u}^{\\prime}\\) remains invariant.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Much like the space of permutation equivariant functions we discussed before in the context of general graphs, there exists a vast amount of \\(\\mathrm{E}(3)\\)-equivariant layers that would satisfy the constraints above--but not all of these layers would be geometrically stable, or easy to implement. In fact, the space of practically useful equivariant layers may well be easily described by a simple categorisation, not unlike our "three flavours" of spatial GNN layers. One elegant solution was suggested by Satorras et al. (2021) in the form of _equivariant message passing_. Their model operates as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\mathbf{f}^{\\prime}_{u} = \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{f}_{u},\\bigoplus_{v\\in\\mathcal{N}_{u}}\\psi_{ \\mathrm{f}}(\\mathbf{f}_{u},\\mathbf{f}_{v},\\|\\mathbf{x}_{u}-\\mathbf{x}_{v}\\|^{2 })\\right),\\] \\[\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}_{u} = \\mathbf{x}_{u}+\\sum_{v\\neq u}(\\mathbf{x}_{u}-\\mathbf{x}_{v})\\psi_ {\\mathrm{c}}(\\mathbf{f}_{u},\\mathbf{f}_{v},\\|\\mathbf{x}_{u}-\\mathbf{x}_{v}\\|^{2})\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(\\psi_{\\mathrm{f}}\\) and \\(\\psi_{\\mathrm{c}}\\) are two distinct (learnable) functions. It can be shown that such an aggregation is equivariant under Euclidean transformations of the spatial coordinates. This is due to the fact that the only dependence of \\(\\mathbf{f}^{\\prime}_{u}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{x}_{u}\\) is through the distances \\(\\|\\mathbf{x}_{u}-\\mathbf{x}_{v}\\|^{2}\\), and the action of \\(\\mathrm{E}(3)\\) necessarily leaves distances between nodes unchanged. Further, the computations of such a layer can be seen as a particular instance of the "message-passing" GNN flavour, hence they are efficient to implement.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To summarise, in contrast to ordinary GNNs, Satorras et al. (2021) enable the correct treatment of \'coordinates\' for each point in the graph. They are now treated as a member of the \\(\\mathrm{E}(3)\\) group, which means the network outputs behave correctly under rotations, reflections and translations of the input. The features, \\(\\mathbf{f}_{u}\\), however, are treated in a channel-wise manner and still assumed to be _scalars_ that do not change under these transformations. This limits the type of spatial information that can be captured within such a framework. For example, it may be desirable for some features to be encoded as _vectors_--e.g. point velocities--which _should_ change direction under such transformations. Satorras et al. (2021) partially alleviate this issue by introducing the concept of velocities in one variant of their architecture. Velocities are a 3D vector property of each point which rotates appropriately. However, this is only a small subspace of the general representations that could be learned with an \\(\\mathrm{E}(3)\\) equivariant network. In general, node features may encode _tensors_ of arbitrary dimensionality that would still transform according to \\(\\mathrm{E}(3)\\) in a well-defined manner.\n' +

      'Hence, while the architecture discussed above already presents an elegant equivariant solution for many practical input representations, in some cases it may be desirable to explore a broader collection of functions that satisfy the equivariance property. Existing methods dealing with such settings can be categorised into two classes: _irreducible representations_ (of which the previously mentioned layer is a simplified instance) and _regular representations_.

      'Meshes, in particular, triangular ones, are the \'bread and butter\' of computer graphics and perhaps the most common way of modeling 3D objects. The remarkable success of deep learning in general and CNNs in computer vision in particular has lead to a keen interest in the graphics and geometry processing community around the mid-2010s to construct similar architectures for mesh data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Geodesic patchesMost of the architectures for deep learning on meshes implement convolutional filters of the form (21) by discretising or approximating the exponential map and expressing the filter in a coordinate system of the tangent plane. Shooting a geodesic \\(\\gamma:[0,T]\\to\\Omega\\) from a point \\(u=\\gamma(0)\\) to nearby point \\(v=\\gamma(T)\\) defines a local system of _geodesic polar coordinates_\\((r(u,v),\\vartheta(u,v))\\) where \\(r\\) is the geodesic distance between \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) (length of the geodesic \\(\\gamma\\)) and \\(\\vartheta\\) is the angle between \\(\\gamma^{\\prime}(0)\\) and some local reference direction. This allows to define a _geodesic patch_\\(x(u,r,\\vartheta)=x(\\exp_{u}\\tilde{\\omega}(r,\\vartheta))\\), where \\(\\tilde{\\omega}_{u}:[0,R]\\times[0,2\\pi)\\to T_{u}\\Omega\\) is the local polar frame.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On a surface discretised as a mesh, a geodesic is a poly-line that traverses the triangular faces. Traditionally, geodesics have been computed using the Fast Marching algorithm Kimmel and Sethian (1998), an efficient numerical approximation of a nonlinear PDE called the _eikonal equation_ encountered in physical models of wave propagation in a medium. This scheme was adapted by Kokkinos et al. (2012) for the computation of local geodesic patches and later reused by Masci et al. (2015) for the construction of _Geodesic CNNs_, the first intrinsic CNN-like architectures on meshes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Isotropic filtersImportantly, in the definition of the geodesic patch we have ambiguity in the choice of the reference direction and the patch orientation. This is exactly the ambiguity of the choice of the gauge, and our local system of coordinates is defined up to arbitrary rotation (or a shift in the angular coordinate, \\(x(u,r,\\vartheta+\\vartheta_{0})\\)), which can be different at every node. Perhapsthe most straightforward solution is to use isotropic filters of the form \\(\\theta(r)\\) that perform a direction-independent aggregation of the neighbour features,\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Spectral filters discussed in Sections 4.4-4.6 fall under this category: they are based on the Laplacian operator, which is isotropic. Such an approach, however, discards important directional information, and might fail to extract edge-like features.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fixed gaugeAn alternative, to which we have already alluded in Section 4.4, is to _fix some gauge_. Monti et al. (2017) used the principal curvature directions: while this choice is not intrinsic and may ambiguous at flat points (where curvature vanishes) or uniform curvature (such as on a perfect sphere), the authors showed that it is reasonable for dealing with deformable human body shapes, which are approximately piecewise-rigid. Later works, e.g. Melzi et al. (2019), showed reliable intrinsic construction of gauges on meshes, computed as (intrinsic) gradients of intrinsic functions. While such tangent fields might have singularities (i.e., vanish at some points), the overall procedure is very robust to noise and remeshing.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Angular poolingAnother approach, referred to as _angular max pooling_, was used by Masci et al. (2015). In this case, the filter \\(\\theta(r,\\vartheta)\\) is anisotropic, but its matching with the function is performed over _all the possible rotations_, which are then aggregated:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[(x\\star\\theta)(u)=\\max_{\\vartheta_{0}\\in[0,2\\pi)}\\ \\int_{0}^{R}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}x(u,r, \\vartheta)\\theta(r,\\vartheta+\\vartheta_{0})\\mathrm{d}r\\mathrm{d}\\vartheta.\\]\n' +

      'Conceptually, this can be visualised as correlating geodesic patches with a rotating filter and collecting the strongest responses.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On meshes, the continuous integrals can be discretised using a construction referred to as _patch operators_(Masci et al., 2015). In a geodesic patch around node \\(u\\), the neighbour nodes \\(\\mathcal{N}_{u}\\), represented in the local polar coordinates as \\((r_{uv},\\vartheta_{uv})\\), are weighted by a set of weighting functions \\(w_{1}(r,\\vartheta),\\ldots,w_{K}(r,\\vartheta)\\) (shown in Figure 18 and acting as\'soft pixels\') and aggregated,\n' +

Multi-channel features are treated channel-wise, with a family of appropriate filters. Masci et al. (2015); Boscaini et al. (2016a) used pre-defined weighting functions \\(w\\), while Monti et al. (2017) further allowed them to be learnable.\n' +

      'Gauge-equivariant filtersBoth isotropic filters and angular max pooling lead to features that are _invariant_ to gauge transformations; they transform according to the trivial representation \\(\\rho(\\mathfrak{g})=1\\) (where \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\in\\mathrm{SO}(2)\\) is a rotation of the local coordinate frame). This point of view suggests another approach, proposed by Cohen et al. (2019); de Haan et al.

Further, it has single-handedly spurred some of the most influential research on RNNs. For a more detailed overview, we refer the reader to Pascanu et al.

      '\n' +
      'Finally, we swap \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) with the aforementioned learnable function, \\(\\Gamma\\). This gives us the required form for our time warping-invariant RNN:\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We may quickly deduce that SimpleRNNs (Equation 39) are _not_ time warping invariant, given that they do not feature the second term in Equation 53. Instead, they fully overwrite \\(\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}\\) with \\(R(\\mathbf{z}^{(t+1)},\\mathbf{h}^{(t)})\\), which corresponds to assuming no time warping at all; \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}=1\\), i.e. \\(\\tau(t)=t\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Further, our link between continuous-time RNNs and the discrete RNN based on \\(R\\) rested on the accuracy of the Taylor approximation, which holds only if the time-warping derivative is not too large, i.e., \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\lesssim 1\\). The intuitive explanation of this is: if our time warping operation ever _contracts time_ in a way that makes time increments \\((t\\to t+1)\\) large enough that intermediate data changes are not sampled, the model can never hope to process time-warped inputs in the same way as original ones--it simply would not have access to the same information. Conversely, time _dilations_ of any form (which, in discrete terms, correspond to interspersing the input time-series with zeroes) are perfectly allowed within our framework.\n' +

      '_exactly_ matching the LSTM gating equations (e.g. Equation 44). The main difference is that LSTMs compute gating _vectors_, whereas Equation 53 implies \\(\\Gamma\\) should output a scalar. Vectorised gates (Hochreiter, 1991) allow to fit a _different_ warping derivative in every dimension of \\(\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}\\), allowing for reasoning over _multiple_ time horizons simultaneously.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is worth taking a pause here to summarise what we have done. By requiring that our RNN class is invariant to (non-destructive) time warping, we have derived the necessary form that it must have (Equation 53), and showed that it exactly corresponds to the class of _gated_ RNNs. The gates\' primary role under this perspective is to accurately fit the _derivative_\\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tau(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) of the warping transformation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The notion of _class invariance_ is somewhat distinct from the invariances we studied previously. Namely, once we train a gated RNN on a time-warped input with \\(\\tau_{1}(t)\\), we typically cannot zero-shot transfer it to a signal warped by a different \\(\\tau_{2}(t)\\). Rather, class invariance only guarantees that gated RNNs are powerful enough to fit both of these signals in the same manner, but potentially with vastly different model parameters. That being said, the realisation that effective gating mechanisms are tightly related to fitting the warping derivative can yield useful prescriptions for gated RNN optimisation, as we now briefly demonstrate.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For example, we can often assume that the range of the dependencies we are interested in tracking within our signal will be in the range \\([T_{l},T_{h}]\\) time-steps.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By analysing the analytic solutions to Equation 52, it can be shown that the characteristic _forgetting time_ of \\(\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}\\) by our gated RNN is proportional to \\(\\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\mathbf{z}^{(t+1)},\\mathbf{h}^{(t)})}\\). Hence, we would like our gating values to lie between \\(\\left[\\frac{1}{T_{h}},\\frac{1}{T_{m}}\\right]\\) in order to effectively remember information within the assumed range.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Further, if we assume that \\(\\mathbf{z}^{(t)}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{h}^{(t)}\\) are roughly _zero-centered_--which is a common by-product of applying transformations such as layer normalisation (Ba et al., 2016)--we can assume that \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\Gamma(\\mathbf{z}^{(t+1)},\\mathbf{h}^{(t)})]\\approx\\mathrm{ logistic}(\\mathbf{b}_{\\Gamma})\\). Controlling the _bias_ vector of the gating mechanism is hence a very powerful way of controlling the effective gate value.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Combining the two observations, we conclude that an appropriate range of gating values can be obtained by initialising \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\Gamma}\\sim-\\log(\\mathcal{U}(T_{l},T_{h})-1)\\), where \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) is the uniform real distribution. Such a recommendation was dubbed _chrono initialisation_ by Tallec and Ollivier (2018), and has been empirically shown to improve the long-range dependency modelling of gated RNNs.\n' +

      'Sequence-to-sequence learning with RNNsOne prominent historical example of using RNN-backed computation are _sequence-to-sequence_ translation tasks, such as _machine translation_ of natural languages.

These findings have then been generalised to the _set2set_ architecture (Vinyals et al., 2016), which generalises seq2seq models to unordered sets, supported by pointer network-backed LSTMs.\n' +

      '## 6 Problems and Applications\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Invariances and symmetries arise all too commonly across data originating in the real world. Hence, it should come as no surprise that some of the most popular applications of machine learning in the 21st century have come about as a direct byproduct of Geometric Deep Learning, perhaps sometimes without fully realising this fact. We would like to provide readers with an overview--by no means comprehensive--of influential works in Geometric Deep Learning and exciting and promising new applications. Our motivation is twofold: to demonstrate specific instances of scientific and industrial problems where the five geometric domains commonly arise, and to serve additional motivation for further study of Geometric Deep Learning principles and architectures.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Chemistry and Drug DesignOne of the most promising applications of representation learning on graphs is in computational chemistry and _drug development_. Traditional drugs are small molecules that are designed to chemically attach (\'bind\') to some target molecule, typically a protein, in order to activate or disrupt some disease-related chemical process. Unfortunately, drug development is an extremely long and expensive process: at the time of writing, bringing a new drug to the market typically takes more than a decade and costs more than a billion dollars. One of the reasons is the cost of testing where many drugs fail at different stages - less than 5% of candidates make it to the last stage (see e.g. Gaudelet et al. (2020)).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since the space of chemically synthesisable molecules is very large (estimated around \\(10^{60}\\)), the search for candidate molecules with the right combination of properties such as target binding affinity, low toxicity, solubility, etc. cannot be done experimentally, and _virtual_ or _in silico screening_ (i.e., the use of computational techniques to identify promising molecules), is employed. Machine learning techniques play an increasingly more prominent role in this task. A prominent example of the use of Geometric Deep Learning for virtual drug screening was recently shown by Stokes et al. (2020) using a graph neural network trained to predict whether or not candidate molecules inhibit growth in the model bacterium _Escherichia coli_, they were able to effectively discover that _Halicin_, a molecule originally indicated for treating diabetes, is a highly potent antibiotic, even against bacteria strains with known antibiotic resistance. This discovery was widely covered in both scientific and popular press.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Speaking more broadly, the application of graph neural networks to molecules modeled as graphs has been a very active field, with multiple specialised architectures proposed recently that are inspired by physics and e.g. incorporate equivariance to rotations and translations (see e.g. Thomas et al. (2018); Anderson et al. (2019); Fuchs et al. (2020); Satorras et al. (2021)). Further, Bapst et al. (2020) have successfully demonstrated the utility of GNNs for predictively modelling the dynamics of glass, in a manner that outperformed the previously available physics-based models. Historically, many works in computational chemistry were precursors of modern graph neural network architectures sharing many common traits with them.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Drug RepositionWhile generating entirely novel drug candidates is a potentially viable approach, a faster and cheaper avenue for developing new therapies is _drug repositioning_, which seeks to evaluate already-approved drugs (either alone or in combinations) for a novel purpose. This often significantly decreases the amount of clinical evaluation that is necessary to release the drug to the market. At some level of abstraction, the action of drugs on the body biochemistry and their interactions between each other and other biomolecules can be modeled as a graph, giving rise to the concept of \'network medicine\' coined by the prominent network scientist Albert-Laszlo Barabasi and advocating the use of biological networks (such as protein-protein interactions and metabolic pathways) to develop new therapies (Barabasi et al., 2011).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Geometric Deep Learning offers a modern take on this class of approaches. A prominent early example is the work of Zitnik et al. (2018), who used graph neural networks to predict side effects in a form of drug repositioning known as _combinatorial therapy_ or _polypharmacy_, formulated as edge prediction in a drug-drug interaction graph. The novel coronavirus pandemic, which is largely ongoing at the time of writing this text, has sparked a particular interest in attempting to apply such approaches against COVID-19 (Gysi et al., 2020). Finally, we should note that drug repositioning is not necessarily limited to synthetic molecules: Veselkov et al. (2019) applied similar approaches to drug-like molecules contained in food (since, as we mentioned, many plant-based foods contain biological analogues of compounds used in oncological therapy). One of the authors of this text is involved in a collaboration adding a creative twist to this research, by partnering with a molecular chef that designs exciting recipes based on the \'hyperfood\' ingredients rich in such drug-like molecules.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Protein biologySince we have already mentioned proteins as drug targets, lets us spend a few more moments on this topic. Proteins are arguably among the most important biomolecules that have myriads of functions in our body, including protection against pathogens (antibodies), giving structure to our skin (collagen), transporting oxygen to cells (haemglobin), catalysing chemical reactions (enzymes), and signaling (many hormones are proteins). Chemically speaking, a protein is a biopolymer, or a chain of small building blocks called _aminoacids_ that under the influence of electrostatic forces fold into a complex 3D structure. It is this structure that endows the protein with its functions, and hence it is crucial to the understanding of how proteins work and what they do. Since proteins are common targets for drug therapies, the pharmaceutical industry has a keen interest in this field.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A typical hierarchy of problems in protein bioinformatics is going from protein _sequence_ (a 1D string over an alphabet of of 20 different amino acids) to 3D _structure_ (a problem known as \'protein folding\') to _function_ (\'protein function prediction\'). Recent approaches such as DeepMind\'s AlphaFold by Senior et al. (2020) used _contact graphs_ to represent the protein structure. Gligorijevic et al. (2020) showed that applying graph neural networks on such graphs allows to achieve better function prediction than using purely sequence-based methods.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Gainza et al. (2020) developed a Geometric Deep Learning pipeline called MaSIF predicting interactions between proteins from their 3D structure. MaSIF models the protein as a molecular surface discretised as a mesh, arguing that this representation is advantageous when dealing with interactions as it allows to abstract the internal fold structure. The architecture was based on mesh convolutional neural network operating on pre-computed chemical and geometric features in small local geodesic patches. The network was trained using a few thousand co-crystal protein 3D structures from the Protein Data Bank to address multiple tasks, including interface prediction, ligand classification, and docking, and allowed to do _de novo_ (\'from scratch\') design of proteins that could in principle act as biological immunotherapy drug against cancer - such proteins are designed to inhibit protein-protein interactions (PPI) between parts of the programmed cell death protein complex (PD-1/PD-L1) and give the immune system the ability to attack the tumor cells.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recommender Systems and Social NetworksThe first popularised large-scale applications of graph representation learning have occurred within _social networks_, primarily in the context of _recommender systems_. Recommenders are tasked with deciding which content to serve to users, potentially depending on their previous history of interactions on the service. This is typically realised through a _link prediction_ objective: supervise the embeddings of various nodes (pieces of content) such that they are kept close together if they are deemed _related_ (e.g. commonly viewed together). Then the _proximity_ of two embeddings (e.g. their inner product) can be interpreted as the probability that they are linked by an edge in the content graph, and hence for any content queried by users, one approach could serve its \\(k\\) nearest neighbours in the embedding space.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Among the pioneers of this methodology is the American image sharing and social media company Pinterest: besides presenting one of the first successful deployments of GNNs in production, their method, PinSage, successfully made graph representation learning _scalable_ to graphs of millions of nodes and billions of edges (Ying et al., 2018). Related applications, particularly in the space of product recommendations, soon followed. Popular GNN-backed recommenders that are currently deployed in production include Alibaba\'s Aligraph (Zhu et al., 2019) and Amazon\'s P-Companion (Hao et al., 2020). In this way, graph deep learning is influencing millions of people on a daily level.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Within the context of content analysis on social networks, another noteworthy effort is Fabula AI, which is among the first GNN-based startups to be acquired (in 2019, by Twitter). The startup, founded by one of the authors of the text and his team, developed novel technology for detectingmisinformation on social networks (Monti et al., 2019). Fabula\'s solution consists of modelling the spread of a particular news item by the network of users who shared it. The users are connected if one of them re-shared the information from the other, but also if they follow each other on the social network. This graph is then fed into a graph neural network, which classifies the entire graph as either \'true\' or \'fake\' content - with labels based on agreement between fact-checking bodies. Besides demonstrating strong predictive power which stabilises quickly (often within a few hours of the news spreading), analysing the embeddings of individual user nodes revealed clear clustering of users who tend to share incorrect information, exemplifying the well-known _\'echo chamber\'_ effect.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Traffic forecastingTransportation networks are another area where Geometric Deep Learning techniques are already making an actionable impact over billions of users worldwide. For example, on road networks, we can observe intersections as nodes, and road segments as edges connecting them--these edges can then be featureised by the road length, current or historical speeds along their segment, and the like.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One standard prediction problem in this space is predicting the _estimated time of arrival_ (ETA): for a given candidate route, providing the expected travel time necessary to traverse it. Such a problem is essential in this space, not only for user-facing traffic recommendation apps, but also for enterprises (such as food delivery or ride-sharing services) that leverage these predictions within their own operations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Graph neural networks have shown immense promise in this space as well: they can, for example, be used to directly predict the ETA for a relevant subgraph of the road network (effectively, a _graph regression_ task). Such an approach was successfully leveraged by DeepMind, yielding a GNN-based ETA predictor which is now deployed in production at Google Maps (Derrow-Pinion et al., 2021), serving ETA queries in several major metropolitan areas worldwide. Similar returns have been observed by the Baidu Maps team, where travel time predictions are currently served by the ConSTGAT model, which is itself based on a spatio-temporal variant of the graph attention network model (Fang et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Object recognitionA principal benchmark for machine learning techniques in computer vision is the ability to _classify_ a central object within a provided image. The ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge (Russakovsky et al., 2015, ILSVRC) was an annual object classification challenge that propelled much of the early development in Geometric Deep Learning. ImageNet requires models to classify realistic images scraped from the Web into one of 1000 categories: such categories are at the same time diverse (covering both animate and inanimate objects), and specific (with many classes focused on distinguishing various cat and dog breeds). Hence, good performance on ImageNet often implies a solid level of feature extraction from general photographs, which formed a foundation for various _transfer learning_ setups from pre-trained ImageNet models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The success of convolutional neural networks on ImageNet--particularly the AlexNet model of Krizhevsky et al. (2012), which swept ILSVRC 2012 by a large margin--has in a large way spearheaded the adoption of deep learning as a whole, both in academia and in industry. Since then, CNNs have consistently ranked on top of the ILSVRC, spawning many popular architectures such as VGG-16 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), Inception (Szegedy et al., 2015) and ResNets (He et al., 2016), which have successfully surpassed human-level performance on this task. The design decisions and regularisation techniques employed by these architectures (such as rectified linear activations (Nair and Hinton, 2010), dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), skip connections (He et al., 2016) and batch normalisation (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015)) form the backbone of many of the effective CNN models in use today.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Concurrently with object classification, significant progress had been made on object _detection_; that is, isolating all objects of interest within an image, and tagging them with certain classes. Such a task is relevant in a variety of downstream problems, from image captioning all the way to autonomous vehicles. It necessitates a more fine-grained approach, as the predictions need to be _localised_; as such, often, translation equivariant models have proven their worth in this domain. One impactful example in this space includes the R-CNN family of models (Girshick et al., 2014; Girshick, 2015; Ren et al., 2015; He et al., 2017) whereas, in the related field of _semantic segmentation_, the SegNet model of Badrinarayanan et al. (2017) proved influential, with its encoder-decoder architecture relying on the VGG-16 backbone.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Game playingConvolutional neural networks also play a prominent role as translation-invariant feature extractors in _reinforcement learning_ (RL) environments, whenever the observed state can be represented in a grid domain; e.g. this is the case when learning to play video games from pixels. In this case, the CNN is responsible for reducing the input to a flat vector representation, which is then used for deriving _policy_ or _value functions_ that drive the RL agent\'s behaviour. While the specifics of reinforcement learning are not the focus of this section, we do note that some of the most impactful results of deep learning in the past decade have come about through CNN-backed reinforcement learning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One particular example that is certainly worth mentioning here is DeepMind\'s _AlphaGo_(Silver et al., 2016). It encodes the current state within a game of Go by applying a CNN to the \\(19\\times 19\\) grid representing the current positions of the placed stones. Then, through a combination of learning from previous expert moves, Monte Carlo tree search, and self-play, it had successfully reached a level of Go mastery that was sufficient to outperform Lee Sedol, one of the strongest Go players of all time, in a five-round challenge match that was widely publicised worldwide.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While this already represented a significant milestone for broader artificial intelligence--with Go having a substantially more complex state-space than, say, chess--the development of AlphaGo did not stop there. The authors gradually removed more and more Go-specific biases from the architecture, with _AlphaGo Zero_ removing human biases, optimising purely through self-play (Silver et al., 2017), _AlphaZero_ expands this algorithm to related two-player games, such as Chess and Shogi; lastly, _MuZero_(Schrittwieser et al., 2020) incorporates a model that enables _learning_ the rules of the game on-the-fly, which allows reaching strong performance in the Atari 2600 console, as well as Go, Chess and Shogi, without any upfront knowledge of the rules. Throughout all of these developments, CNNs remained the backbone behind these models\' representation of the input.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While several high-performing RL agents were proposed for the Atari 2600 platform over the years (Mnih et al., 2015, 2016; Schulman et al., 2017), for a long time they were unable to reach human-level performance on _all_ of the 57 games provided therein. This barrier was finally broken with Agent57 (Badia et al., 2020), which used a parametric family of policies, ranging from strongly exploratory to purely exploitative, and prioritising them in different ways during different stages of training. It, too, powers most of its computations by a CNN applied to the video game\'s framebuffer.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Text and speech synthesisBesides images (which naturally map to a _two_-dimensional grid), several of (geometric) deep learning\'s strongest successes have happened on one-dimensional grids. Natural examples of this are _text_ and _speech_, folding the Geometric Deep Learning blueprint within diverse areas such as natural language processing and digital signal processing.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Some of the most widely applied and publicised works in this space focus on _synthesis_: being able to generate speech or text, either unconditionally or conditioned on a particular _prompt_. Such a setup can support a plethora of useful tasks, such as _text-to-speech_ (TTS), predictive text completion, and machine translation. Various neural architectures for text and speech generation have been proposed over the past decade, initially mostly based on _recurrent_ neural networks (e.g. the aforementioned seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014) or recurrent attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014)). However, in recent times, they have been gradually replaced by convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One particular limitation of simple 1D convolutions in this setting is their linearly growing _receptive field_, requiring many layers in order to cover the sequence generated so far. _Dilated_ convolutions, instead, offer an _exponentially_ growing receptive field with an equivalent number of parameters. Owing to this, they proved a very strong alternative, eventually becoming competitive with RNNs on machine translation (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016), while drastically reducing the computational complexity, owing to their parallelisability across all input positions. The most well-known application of dilated convolutions is the _WaveNet_ model from van den Oord et al. (2016). WaveNets demonstrated that, using dilations, it is possible to synthesise speech at the level of _raw waveform_ (typically 16,000 samples per second or more), producing speech samples that were significantly more "human-like" than the best previous text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Subsequently, it was further demonstrated that the computations of WaveNets can be distilled in a much simpler model, the _WaveRNN_(Kalchbrenner et al., 2018)--and this model enabled effectively deploying this technology at an industrial scale. This allowed not only its deployment for large-scale speech generation for services such as the Google Assistant, but also allowing for efficient on-device computations; e.g. for Google Duo, which uses end-to-end encryption.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have managed to surpass the limitations of both recurrent and convolutional architectures, showing that _self-attention_ is sufficient for achieving state-of-the-art performance in machine translation. Subsequently, they have revolutionised natural language processing. Through the pre-trained embeddings provided by models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), Transformer computations have become enabled for a large amount of downstream applications of natural language processing--for example, Google uses BERT embeddings to power its search engine.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Arguably the most widely publicised application of Transformers in the past years is text generation, spurred primarily by the _Generative Pre-trained Transformer_(GPT, Radford et al. (2018, 2019); Brown et al. (2020)) family of models from OpenAI. In particular, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) successfully scaled language model learning to 175 billion learnable parameters, trained on next-word prediction on web-scale amounts of scraped textual corpora. This allowed it not only to become a highly-potent few-shot learner on a variety of language-based tasks, but also a text generator with capability to produce coherent and human-sounding pieces of text. This capability not only implied a large amount of downstream applications, but also induced a vast media coverage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'HealthcareApplications in the medical domain are another promising area for Geometric Deep Learning. There are multiple ways in which these methods are being used. First, more traditional architectures such as CNNs have been applied to grid-structured data, for example, for the prediction of length of stay in Intensive Care Units (Rocheteau et al., 2020), or diagnosis of sight-threatening diseases from retinal scans (De Fauw et al., 2018). Winkels and Cohen (2019) showed that using 3D roto-translation group convolutional networks improves the accuracy of pulmonary nodule detection compared to conventional CNNs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Second, modelling organs as geometric surfaces, mesh convolutional neural networks were shown to be able to address a diverse range of tasks, from reconstructing facial structure from genetics-related information (Mahdi et al., 2020) to brain cortex parcellation (Cucurull et al., 2018) to regressing demographic properties from cortical surface structures (Besson et al., 2020). The latter examples represent an increasing trend in neuroscience to consider the brain as a surface with complex folds giving rise to highly non-Euclidean structures.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'At the same time, neuroscientists often try construct and analyse _functional networks_ of the brain representing the various regions of the brain that are activated together when performing some cognitive function; these networks are often constructed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that shows in real time which areas of the brain consume more blood. These functional networks can reveal patient demographics (e.g., telling apart males from females, Arslan et al. (2018)), as well as used for neuropathology diagnosis, which is the third area of application of Geometric Deep Learning in medicine we would like to highlight here. In this context, Ktena et al. (2017) pioneered the use of graph neural networks for the prediction of neurological conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder. The geometric and functional structure of the brain appears to be intimately related, and recently Irani and Thanou (2021) pointed to the benefits of exploiting them jointly in neurological disease analysis.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fourth, _patient networks_ are becoming more prominent in ML-based medical diagnosis. The rationale behind these methods is that the information of patient demographic, genotypic, and phenotypic similarity could improve predicting their disease. Parisot et al. (2018) applied graph neural networks on networks of patients created from demographic features for neurological disease diagnosis, showing that the use of the graph improves prediction results. Cosmo et al. (2020) showed the benefits of latent graph learning (by which the network _learns_ an unknown patient graph) in this setting. The latter work used data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale collection of medical data including brain imaging (Miller et al., 2016).\n' +

      'A wealth of data about hospital patients may be found in _electronic health records_ (EHRs). Besides giving a comprehensive view of the patient\'s progression, EHR analysis allows for _relating_ similar patients together. This aligns with the _pattern recognition method_, which is commonly used in diagnostics. Therein, the clinician uses _experience_ to recognise a pattern of clinical characteristics, and it may be the primary method used when the clinician\'s experience may enable them to diagnose the condition quickly. Along these lines, several works attempt to construct a patient graph based on EHR data, either by analysing the embeddings of their doctor\'s notes (Malone et al., 2018), diagnosis similarity on admission (Rocheteau et al., 2021), or even assuming a fully-connected graph (Zhu and Razavian, 2019). In all cases, promising results have been shown in favour of using graph representation learning for processing EHRs.\n' +

      'Particle physics and astrophysicsHigh energy physicists were perhaps among the first domain experts in the field of natural sciences to embrace the new shiny tool, graph neural networks. In a recent review paper, Shlomi et al. (2020) note that machine learning has historically been heavily used in particle physics experiments, either to learn complicated inverse functions allowing to infer the underlying physics process from the information measured in the detector, or to perform classification and regression tasks. For the latter, it was often necessary to force the data into an unnatural representation such as grid, in order to be able to used standard deep learning architectures such as CNN. Yet, many problems in physics involve data in the form of unordered sets with rich relations and interactions, which can be naturally represented as graphs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One important application in high-energy physics is the reconstruction and classification of _particle jets_ - sprays of stable particles arising from multiple successive interaction and decays of particles originating from a single initial event. In the Large Hardon Collider, the largest and best-known particle accelerator built at CERN, such jet are the result of collisions of protons at nearly the speed of light. These collisions produce massive particles, such as the long though-for Higgs boson or the top quark. The identification and classification of collision events is of crucial importance, as it might provide experimental evidence to the existence of new particles.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Multiple Geometric Deep Learning approaches have recently been proposed for particle jet classification task, e.g. by Komiske et al. (2019) and Qu and Gouskos (2019), based on DeepSet and Dynamic Graph CNN architectures, respectively. More recently, there has also been interest in developing specialised architectures derived from physics consideration and incorporating inductive biases consistent with Hamiltonian or Lagrangian mechanics (see e.g. Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. (2019); Cranmer et al. (2020)), equivariant to the Lorentz group (a fundamental symmetry of space and time in physics) (Bogatskiy et al., 2020), or even incorporating symbolic reasoning (Cranmer et al., 2019) and capable of learning physical laws from data. Such approaches are more interpretable (and thus considered more \'trustworthy\' by domain experts) and also offer better generalisation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Besides particle accelerators, particle detectors are now being used by astrophysicist for _multi-messenger astronomy_ - a new way of coordinated observation of disparate signals, such as electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, and neutrinos, coming from the same source. Neutrino astronomy is of particular interest, since neutrinos interact only very rarely with matter, and thus travel enormous distances practically unaffected. Detecting neutrinos allows to observe objects inaccessible to optical telescopes, but requires enormously-sized detectors - the IceCube neutrino observatory uses a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice shelf on the South Pole as its detector. Detecting high-energy neutrinos can possibly shed lights on some of the most mysterious objects in the Universe, such as blazars and black holes. Choma et al. (2018) used a Geometric neural network to model the irregular geometry of the IceCube neutrino detector, showing significantly better performance in detecting neutrinos coming from astrophysical sources and separating them from background events.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While neutrino astronomy offers a big promise in the study of the Cosmos, traditional optical and radio telescopes are still the \'battle horses\' of astronomers. With these traditional instruments, Geometric Deep Learning can still offer new methodologies for data analysis. For example, Scaife and Porter (2021) used rotationally-equivariant CNNs for the classification of radio galaxies, and McEwen et al. (2021) used spherical CNNs for the analysis of cosmic microwave background radiation, a relic from the Big Bang that might shed light on the formation of the primordial Universe. As we already mentioned, such signals are naturally represented on the sphere and equivariant neural networks are an appropriate tool to study them.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Virtual and Augmented RealityAnother field of applications which served as the motivation for the development of a large class of Geometric Deep Learning methods is computer vision and graphics, in particular, dealing with 3D body models for virtual and augmented reality. Motion capture technology used to produce special effects in movies like Avatar often operates in two stages: first, the input from a 3D scanner capturing the motions of the body or the face of the actor is put into correspondence with some canonical shape, typically modelled as a discrete manifold or a mesh (this problem is often called \'analysis\'). Second, a new shape is generated to repeat the motion of the input (\'synthesis\'). Initial works on Geometric Deep Learning in computer graphics and vision (Masci et al., 2015; Boscaini et al., 2016; Monti et al., 2017) developed mesh convolutional neural networks to address the analysis problem, or more specifically, deformable shape correspondence.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'First geometric autoencoder architectures for 3D shape synthesis were proposed independently by Litany et al. (2018) and Ranjan et al. (2018). Inthese architectures, a canonical mesh (of the body, face, or hand) was assumed to be known and the synthesis task consisted of regressing the 3D coordinates of the nodes (the embedding of the surface, using the jargon of differential geometry). Kulon et al. (2020) showed a hybrid pipeline for 3D hand pose estimation with an image CNN-based encoder and a geometric decoder. A demo of this system, developed in collaboration with a British startup company Ariel AI and presented at CVPR 2020, allowed to create realistic body avatars with fully articulated hands from video input on a mobile phone faster than real-time. Ariel AI was acquired by Snap in 2020, and at the time of writing its technology is used in Snap\'s augmented reality products.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '"Symmetry, as wide or as narrow as you may define its meaning, is one idea by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order, beauty, and perfection." This somewhat poetic definition of symmetry is given in the eponymous book of the great mathematician Hermann Weyl (2015), his _Schwanengesang_ on the eve of retirement from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Weyl traces the special place symmetry has occupied in science and art to the ancient times, from Sumerian symmetric designs to the Pythagoreans who believed the circle to be perfect due to its rotational symmetry. Plato considered the five regular polyhedra bearing his name today so fundamental that they must be the basic building blocks shaping the material world. Yet, though Plato is credited with coining the term \\(\\sigma\\)\\(\\sigma\\)\\(\\sigma\\)\\(\\sigma\\), which literally translates as\'same measure\', he used it only vaguely to convey the beauty of proportion in art and harmony in music. It was the astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler to attempt the first rigorous analysis of the symmetric shape of water crystals. In his treatise (\'On the Six-Cornered Snowflake\'), he attributed the six-fold dihedral structure of snowflakes to hexagonal packing of particles - an idea that though preceded the clear understanding of how matter is formed, still holds today as the basis of crystallography (Ball, 2011).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Symmetry in Mathematics and PhysicsIn modern mathematics, symmetry is almost univocally expressed in the language of group theory. The origins of this theory are usually attributed to Evariste Galois, who coinedthe term and used it to study solvability of polynomial equations in the 1830s. Two other names associated with group theory are those of Sophus Lie and Felix Klein, who met and worked fruitfully together for a period of time (Tobies, 2019). The former would develop the theory of continuous symmetries that today bears his name; the latter proclaimed group theory to be the organising principle of geometry in his Erlangen Program, which we mentioned in the beginning of this text. Riemannian geometry was explicitly excluded from Klein\'s unified geometric picture, and it took another fifty years before it was integrated, largely thanks to the work of Elie Cartan in the 1920s.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Emmy Noether, Klein\'s colleague in Gottingen, proved that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law (Noether, 1918). In physics, it was a stunning result: beforehand, meticulous experimental observation was required to discover fundamental laws such as the conservation of energy, and even then, it was an empirical result not coming from anywhere. Noether\'s Theorem -- "a guiding star to 20th and 21st century physics", in the words of the Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek -- showed that the conservation of energy emerges from the translational symmetry of time, a rather intuitive idea that the results of an experiment should not depend on whether it is conducted today or tomorrow.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The symmetry associated with charge conservation is the global _gauge invariance_ of the electromagnetic field, first appearing in Maxwell\'s formulation of electrodynamics (Maxwell, 1865); however, its importance initially remained unnoticed. The same Hermann Weyl who wrote so dithyrambically about symmetry is the one who first introduced the concept of gauge invariance in physics in the early 20th century, emphasizing its role as a principle from which electromagnetism can be _derived_. It took several decades until this fundamental principle -- in its generalised form developed by Yang and Mills (1954) -- proved successful in providing a unified framework to describe the quantum-mechanical behavior of electromagnetism and the weak and strong forces, finally culminating in the Standard Model that captures all the fundamental forces of nature but gravity. We can thus join another Nobel-winning physicist, Philip Anderson (1972), in concluding that "it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry."Early Use of Symmetry in Machine LearningIn machine learning and its applications to pattern recognition and computer vision, the importance of symmetry has long been recognised. Early work on designing equivariant feature detectors for pattern recognition was done by Amari (1978), Kanatani (2012), and Lenz (1990). In the neural networks literature, the famous group Invariance Theorem for Perceptrons by Minsky and Papert (2017) puts fundamental limitations on the capabilities of (single-layer) perceptrons to learn invariants. This was one of the primary motivations for studying multi-layer architectures (Sejnowski et al., 1986; Shawe-Taylor, 1989, 1993), which ultimately led to deep learning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the neural network community, _Neocognitron_(Fukushima and Miyake, 1982) is credited as the first implementation of shift invariance in a neural network for "pattern recognition unaffected by shift in position". His solution came in the form of hierarchical neural network with local connectivity, drawing inspiration from the receptive fields discovered in the visual cortex by the neuroscientists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel two decades earlier (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959). These ideas culminated in Convolutional Neural Networks in the seminal work of Yann LeCun and co-authors (LeCun et al., 1998). The first work to take a representation-theoretical view on invariant and equivariant neural networks was performed by Wood and Shawe-Taylor (1996), unfortunately rarely cited. More recent incarnations of these ideas include the works of Makadia et al. (2007); Esteves et al. (2020) and one of the authors of this text (Cohen and Welling, 2016).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Graph Neural NetworksIt is difficult to pinpoint exactly when the concept of Graph Neural Networks began to emerge--partly due to the fact that most of the early work did not place graphs as a first-class citizen, partly since GNNs became practical only in the late 2010s, and partly because this field emerged from the confluence of several research areas. That being said, early forms of graph neural networks can be traced back at least to the 1990s, with examples including Alessandro Sperduti\'s Labeling RAAM (Sperduti, 1994), the "backpropagation through structure" of Goller and Kuchler (1996), and adaptive processing of data structures (Sperduti and Starita, 1997; Frasconi et al., 1998). While these works were primarily concerned with operating over "structures" (often trees or directed acyclic graphs), many of the invariances preserved in their architectures are reminiscent of the GNNs more commonly in use today.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The first proper treatment of the processing of generic graph structures (and the coining of the term _"graph neural network"_) happened after the turn of the 21st century. Within the Artificial Intelligence lab at the Universita degli Studi di Siena (Italy), papers led by Marco Gori and Franco Scarselli have proposed the first "GNN" (Gori et al., 2005; Scarselli et al., 2008). They relied on recurrent mechanisms, required the neural network parameters to specify _contraction mappings_, and thus computing node representations by searching for a fixed point--this in itself necessitated a special form of backpropagation (Almeida, 1990; Pineda, 1988) and did not depend on node features at all. All of the above issues were rectified by the Gated GNN (GGNN) model of Li et al. (2015). GGNNs brought many benefits of modern RNNs, such as gating mechanisms (Cho et al., 2014) and backpropagation through time, to the GNN model, and remain popular today.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Computational chemistryIt is also very important to note an independent and concurrent line of development for GNNs: one that was entirely driven by the needs of computational chemistry, where molecules are most naturally expressed as graphs of atoms (nodes) connected by chemical bonds (edges). This invited computational techniques for molecular property prediction that operate directly over such a graph structure, which had become present in machine learning in the 1990s: this includes the ChemNet model of Kireev (1995) and the work of Baskin et al. (1997). Strikingly, the "molecular graph networks" of Merkwirth and Lengauer (2005) explicitly proposed many of the elements commonly found in contemporary GNNs--such as edge type-conditioned weights or global pooling--as early as 2005. The chemical motivation continued to drive GNN development into the 2010s, with two significant GNN advancements centered around improving molecular fingerprinting (Duvenaud et al., 2015) and predicting quantum-chemical properties (Gilmer et al., 2017) from small molecules. At the time of writing this text, molecular property prediction is one of the most successful applications of GNNs, with impactful results in virtual screening of new antibiotic drugs (Stokes et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Node embeddingsSome of the earliest success stories of deep learning on graphs involve learning representations of nodes in an unsupervised fashion, based on the graph structure. Given their structural inspiration, this direction also provides one of the most direct links between graph representation learning and network science communities. The key early approaches in this space relied on _random walk_-based embeddings: learning node representations in a way that brings them closer together if the nodes co-occur in a short random walk. Representative methods in this space include DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016) and LINE (Tang et al., 2015), which are all purely self-supervised. Planetoid (Yang et al., 2016) was the first in this space to incorporate supervision label information, when it is available.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Unifying random walk objectives with GNN encoders was attempted on several occasions, with representative approaches including Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE, Kipf and Welling (2016)), embedding propagation (Garcia-Duran and Niepert, 2017), and unsupervised variants of GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017). However, this was met with mixed results, and it was shortly discovered that pushing neighbouring node representations together is already a key part of GNNs\' inductive bias. Indeed, it was shown that an _untrained_ GNN was already showing performance that is competitive with DeepWalk, in settings where node features are available (Velickovic et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019). This launched a direction that moves away from combining random walk objectives with GNNs and shifting towards _contrastive_ approaches inspired by mutual information maximisation and aligning to successful methods in the image domain. Prominent examples of this direction include Deep Graph Informax (DGI, Velickovic et al. (2019)), GRACE (Zhu et al., 2020), BERT-like objectives (Hu et al., 2020) and BGRL (Thakoor et al., 2021).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Probabilistic graphical modelsGraph neural networks have also, concurrently, resurged through embedding the computations of _probabilistic graphical models_ (PGMs, Wainwright and Jordan (2008)). PGMs are a powerful tool for processing graphical data, and their utility arises from their probabilistic perspective on the graph\'s edges: namely, the nodes are treated as _random variables_, while the graph structure encodes _conditional independence_ assumptions, allowing for significantly simplifying the calculation and sampling from the joint distribution. Indeed, many algorithms for (exactly or approximately) supporting learning and inference on PGMs rely on forms of passing messages over their edges (Pearl, 2014), with examples including variational mean-field inference and loopy belief propagation (Yedidia et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 2013).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This connection between PGMs and message passing was subsequently developed into GNN architectures, with early theoretical links established by the authors of structure2vec (Dai et al., 2016). Namely, by posing a graph representation learning setting as a Markov random field (of nodes corresponding to input features and latent representations), the authors directly align the computation of both mean-field inference and loopy belief propagation to a model not unlike the GNNs commonly in use today.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The key "trick" which allowed for relating the latent representations of a GNN to probability distributions maintained by a PGM was the usage of _Hilbert-space embeddings_ of distributions (Smola et al., 2007). Given \\(\\phi\\), an appropriately chosen embedding function for features \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), it is possible to embed their probability distribution \\(p(\\mathbf{x})\\) as the _expected_ embedding \\(\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim p(\\mathbf{x})}\\phi(\\mathbf{x})\\). Such a correspondence allows us to perform GNN-like computations, knowing that the representations computed by the GNN will always correspond to an embedding of _some_ probability distribution over the node features.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The structure2vec model itself is, ultimately, a GNN architecture which easily sits within our framework, but its setup has inspired a series of GNN architectures which more directly incorporate computations found in PGMs. Emerging examples have successfully combined GNNs with conditional random fields (Gao et al., 2019; Spalevic et al., 2020), relational Markov networks (Qu et al., 2019) and Markov logic networks (Zhang et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The Weisfeiler-Lehman formalismThe resurgence of graph neural networks was followed closely by a drive to understand their fundamental limitations, especially in terms of expressive power. While it was becoming evident that GNNs are a strong modelling tool of graph-structured data, it was also clear that they wouldn\'t be able to solve _any_ task specified on a graph perfectly. A canonical illustrative example of this is deciding _graph isomorphism_: is our GNN able to attach different representations to two given non-isomorphic graphs? This is a useful framework for two reasons. If the GNN is unable to do this, then it will be hopeless on any task requiring the discrimination of these two graphs. Further, it is currently not known if deciding graph isomorphism is in P, the complexity class in which all GNN computations typically reside.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The key framework which binds GNNs to graph isomorphism is the _Weisfeiler-Lehman_ (WL) graph isomorphism test (Weisfeiler and Leman, 1968). This test generates a graph representation by iteratively passing node featuresalong the edges of the graph, then _randomly hashing_ their sums across neighbourhoods. Connections to _randomly-initialised_ convolutional GNNs are apparent, and have been observed early on: for example, within the GCN model of Kipf and Welling (2016a). Aside from this connection, the WL iteration was previously introduced in the domain of _graph kernels_ by Shervashidze et al. (2011), and it still presents a strong baseline for unsupervised learning of whole-graph representations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While the WL test is conceptually simple, and there are many simple examples of non-isomorphic graphs it cannot distinguish, its expressive power is ultimately strongly tied to GNNs. Analyses by Morris et al. (2019) and Xu et al. (2018) have both reached a striking conclusion: _any_ GNN conforming to one of the three flavours we outlined in Section 5.3 cannot be more powerful than the WL test!\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In order to exactly reach this level of representational power, certain constraints must exist on the GNN update rule. Xu et al. (2018) have shown that, in the discrete-feature domain, the aggregation function the GNN uses must be _injective_, with _summation_ being a key representative. Based on the outcome of their analysis, Xu et al. (2018) propose the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), which is a simple but powerful example of a maximally-expressive GNN under this framework. It is also expressible under the convolutional GNN flavour we propose.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Lastly, it is worth noting that these findings do not generalise to _continuous_ node feature spaces. In fact, using the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (Borsuk, 1933), Corso et al. (2020) have demonstrated that, assuming real-valued node features, obtaining injective aggregation functions requires _multiple_ aggregators (specifically, equal to the _degree_ of the receiver node). Their findings have driven the Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA) architecture, which proposes a multiple-aggregator GNN that is empirically powerful and stable.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Higher-order methodsThe findings of the previous paragraphs do not contradict the practical utility of GNNs. Indeed, in many real-world applications the input features are sufficiently _rich_ to support useful discriminative computations over the graph structure, despite of the above limitations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, one key corollary is that GNNs are relatively quite weak at detecting some rudimentary _structures_ within a graph. Guided by the specific limitations or failure cases of the WL test, several works have provided _stronger_ variants of GNNs that are _provably_ more powerful than the WL test, and hence likely to be useful on tasks that require such structural detection.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Perhaps the most direct place to hunt for more expressive GNNs is the WL test itself. Indeed, the strength of the original WL test can be enhanced by considering a _hierarchy_ of WL tests, such that \\(k\\)-WL tests attach representations to \\(k\\)-_tuples_ of nodes (Morris et al., 2017). The \\(k\\)-WL test has been directly translated into a _higher-order_\\(k\\)-GNN architecture by Morris et al. (2019), which is provably more powerful than the GNN flavours we considered before. However, its requirement to maintain tuple representations implies that, in practice, it is hard to scale beyond \\(k=3\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Concurrently, Maron et al. (2018, 2019) have studied the characterisation of invariant and equivariant graph networks over \\(k\\)-tuples of nodes. Besides demonstrating the surprising result of _any_ invariant or equivariant graph network being expressible as a linear combination of a finite number of generators--the amount of which only depends on \\(k\\)--the authors showed that the expressive power of such layers is equivalent to the \\(k\\)-WL test, and proposed an empirically scalable variant which is provably 3-WL powerful.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Besides generalising the domain over which representations are computed, significant effort had also went into analysing specific failure cases of 1-WL and augmenting GNN _inputs_ to help them distinguish such cases. One common example is attaching _identifying features_ to the nodes, which can help detecting structure. Proposals to do this include _one-hot_ representations (Murphy et al., 2019), as well as purely _random_ features (Sato et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'More broadly, there have been many efforts to incorporate _structural_ information within the message passing process, either by modulating the message function or the graph that the computations are carried over. Several interesting lines of work here involve sampling _anchor node sets_(You et al., 2019), aggregating based on _Laplacian eigenvectors_(Stachenfeld et al., 2020; Beaini et al., 2020; Dwivedi and Bresson, 2020), or performing _topological data analysis_, either for positional embeddings (Bouritsas et al., 2020) or driving message passing (Bodnar et al., 2021).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Signal processing and Harmonic analysisSince the early successes of Convolutional Neural Networks, researchers have resorted to tools from harmonic analysis, image processing, and computational neuroscience trying to provide a theoretical framework that explains their efficiency. \\(M\\)-theory is a framework inspired by the visual cortex, pioneered by Tomaso Poggio and collaborators (Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999; Serre et al., 2007), based on the notion of templates that can be manipulated under certain symmetry groups. Another notable model arising from computational neuroscience were _steerable pyramids_, a form of multiscale wavelet decompositions with favorable properties against certain input transformations, developed by Simoncelli and Freeman (1995). They were a central element in early generative models for textures (Portilla and Simoncelli, 2000), which were subsequently improved by replacing steerable wavelet features with deep CNN features (Gatys et al. (2015). Finally, Scattering transforms, introduced by Stephane Mallat (2012) and developed by Bruna and Mallat (2013), provided a framework to understand CNNs by replacing trainable filters with multiscale wavelet decompositions, also showcasing the deformation stability and the role of depth in the architecture.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Signal Processing on Graph and MeshesAnother important class of graph neural networks, often referred to as _spectral_, has emerged from the work of one of the authors of this text (Bruna et al., 2013), using the notion of the _Graph Fourier transform_. The roots of this construction are in the signal processing and computational harmonic analysis communities, where dealing with non-Euclidean signals has become prominent in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Influential papers from the groups of Pierre Vandergheynst (Shuman et al., 2013) and Jose Moura (Sandryhaila and Moura, 2013) popularised the notion of "Graph Signal Processing" (GSP) and the generalisation of Fourier transforms based on the eigenvectors of graph adjacency and Laplacian matrices. The graph convolutional neural networks relying on spectral filters by Defferrard et al. (2016) and Kipf and Welling (2016) are among the most cited in the field and can likely be credited) as ones reigniting the interest in machine learning on graphs in recent years.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is worth noting that, in the field of computer graphics and geometry processing, non-Euclidean harmonic analysis predates Graph Signal Processing by at least a decade. We can trace spectral filters on manifolds and meshes to the works of Taubin et al. (1996). These methods became mainstream in the 2000s following the influential papers of Karni and Gotsman (2000) on spectral geometry compression and of Levy (2006) on using the Laplacian eigenvectors as a non-Euclidean Fourier basis. Spectral methods have been used for a range of applications, most prominent of which is the construction of shape descriptors (Sun et al., 2009) and functional maps (Ovsjanikov et al., 2012); these methods are still broadly used in computer graphics at the time of writing.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Computer Graphics and Geometry ProcessingModels for shape analysis based on intrinsic metric invariants were introduced by various authors in the field of computer graphics and geometry processing (Elad and Kimmel, 2003; Memoli and Sapiro, 2005; Bronstein et al., 2006), and are discussed in depth by one of the authors in his earlier book (Bronstein et al., 2008). The notions of intrinsic symmetries were also explored in the same field Raviv et al. (2007); Ovsjanikov et al. (2008). The first architecture for deep learning on meshes, Geodesic CNNs, was developed in the team of one of the authors of the text (Masci et al., 2015). This model used local filters with shared weights, applied to geodesic radial patches. It was a particular setting of gauge-equivariant CNNs developed later by another author of the text (Cohen et al., 2019). A generalisation of Geodesic CNNs with learnable aggregation operations, MoNet, proposed by Federico Monti et al. (2017) from the same team, used an attention-like mechanism over the local structural features of the mesh, that was demonstrated to work on general graphs as well. The graph attention network (GAT), which technically speaking can be considered a particular instance of MoNet, was introduced by another author of this text (Velickovic et al., 2018). GATs generalise MoNet\'s attention mechanism to also incorporate node feature information, breaking away from the purely structure-derived relevance of prior work. It is one of the most popular GNN architectures currently in use.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the context of computer graphics, it is also worthwhile to mention that the idea of learning on sets (Zaheer et al., 2017) was concurrently developed in the group of Leo Guibas at Stanford under the name PointNet (Qi et al., 2017) for the analysis of 3D point clouds. This architecture has lead to multiple follow-up works, including one by an author of this text called Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN, Wang et al. (2019b)). DGCNN used a nearest-neighbour graph to capture the local structure of the point cloud to allow exchange of information across the nodes; the key characteristic of this architecture was that the graph was constructed on-the-fly and updated between the layers of the neural network in relation to the downstream task. This latter property made DGCNN one of the first incarnations of \'latent graph learning\', which in its turn has had significant follow up. Extensions to DGCNN\'s \\(k\\)-nearest neighbour graph proposal include more explicit control \n' +

      'propriately preserve algorithmic invariants. The area has investigated the construction of general-purpose neural computers, e.g., the _neural Turing machine_(Graves et al., 2014) and the _differentiable neural computer_(Graves et al., 2016). While such architectures have all the hallmarks of general computation, they introduced several components at once, making them often challenging to optimise, and in practice, they are almost always outperformed by simple relational reasoners, such as the ones proposed by Santoro et al. (2017, 2018).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As modelling complex postconditions is challenging, plentiful work on inductive biases for learning to execute (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2014) has focused on primitive algorithms (e.g. simple arithmetic). Prominent examples in this space include the _neural GPU_(Kaiser and Sutskever, 2015), _neural RAM_(Kurach et al., 2015), _neural programmer-interpreters_(Reed and De Freitas, 2015), _neural arithmetic-logic units_(Trask et al., 2018; Madsen and Johansen, 2020) and _neural execution engines_(Yan et al., 2020).\n' +

      'Emulating combinatorial algorithms of _superlinear_ complexity was made possible with the rapid development of GNN architectures. The _algorithmic alignment_ framework pioneered by Xu et al. (2019) demonstrated, theoretically, that GNNs _align_ with dynamic programming (Bellman, 1966), which is a language in which most algorithms can be expressed. It was concurrently empirically shown, by one of the authors of this text, that it is possible to design and train GNNs that align with algorithmic invariants in practice (Velickovic et al., 2019). Onwards, alignment was achieved with _iterative algorithms_(Tang et al., 2020), _linearithmic algorithms_(Freivalds et al., 2019), _data structures_(Velickovic et al., 2020) and _persistent memory_(Strathmann et al., 2021). Such models have also seen practical use in _implicit planners_(Deac et al., 2020), breaking into the space of _reinforcement learning_ algorithms.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Concurrently, significant progress has been made on using GNNs for _physics simulations_(Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Pfaff et al., 2020). This direction yielded much of the same recommendations for the design of generalising GNNs. Such a correspondence is to be expected: given that algorithms can be phrased as discrete-time simulations, and simulations are typically implemented as step-wise algorithms, both directions will need to preserve similar kinds of invariants.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Tightly bound with the study of algorithmic reasoning are measures of _extrapolation_. This is a notorious pain-point for neural networks, given that most of their success stories are obtained when generalising _in-distribution_;i.e. when the patterns found in the training data properly anticipate the ones found in the test data. However, algorithmic invariants must be preserved irrespective of, e.g., the size or generative distribution of the input, meaning that the training set will likely not cover any possible scenario encountered in practice. Xu et al. (2020) have proposed a geometric argument for what is required of an extrapolating GNN backed by rectifier activations: its components and featureisation would need to be designed so as to make its constituent modules (e.g. message function) learn only _linear_ target functions. Bevilacqua et al. (2021) propose observing extrapolation under the lens of _causal reasoning_, yielding _environment-invariant_ representations of graphs.\n' +

      'Geometric Deep LearningOur final historical remarks regard the very name of this text. The term \'Geometric Deep Learning\' was first introduced by one of the authors of this text in his ERC grant in 2015 and popularised in the eponymous IEEE Signal Processing Magazine paper (Bronstein et al., 2017). This paper proclaimed, albeit "with some caution", the signs of "a new field being born." Given the recent popularity of graph neural networks, the increasing use of ideas of invariance and equivariance in a broad range of machine learning applications, and the very fact of us writing this text, it is probably right to consider this prophecy at least partially fulfilled. The name "4G: Grids, Graphs, Groups, and Gauges" was coined by Max Welling for the ELLIIS Program on Geometric Deep Learning, co-directed by two authors of the text. Admittedly, the last \'G\' is somewhat of a stretch, since the underlying structures are manifolds and bundles rather than gauges. For this text, we added another \'G\', Geodesics, in reference to metric invariants and intrinsic symmetries of manifolds.\n' +

      'This text represents a humble attempt to summarise and synthesise decades of existing knowledge in deep learning architectures, through the geometric lens of invariance and symmetry. We hope that our perspective will make it easier both for newcomers and practitioners to navigate the field, and for researchers to synthesise novel architectures, as instances of our blueprint. In a way, we hope to have presented "_all you need to build the architectures that are all you need"_--a play on words inspired by Vaswani et al. (2017).\n' +

      'The bulk of the text was written during late 2020 and early 2021. As it often happens, we had thousands of doubts whether the whole picture makes sense, and used opportunities provided by our colleagues to help us break our "stage right" and present early versions of our work, which saw the light of day in Petar\'s talk at Cambridge (courtesy of Pietro Lio) and Michael\'s talks at Oxford (courtesy of Xiaowen Dong) and Imperial College (hosted by Michael Huth and Daniel Rueckert). Petar was also able to present our work at Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg--the birthplace of the Erlangen Program!--owing to a kind invitation from Andreas Maier. The feedback we received for these talks was enormously invaluable to keeping our spirits high, as well as polishing the work further. Last, but certainly not least, we thank the organising committee of ICLR 2021, where our work will be featured in a keynote talk, delivered by Michael.\n' +
