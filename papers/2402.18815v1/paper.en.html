      'Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across a spectrum of languages. In this work, we delve into the question: How do LLMs handle multilingual? We introduce a framework that depicts LLMs\' processing of multilingual inputs: In the first several layers, LLMs understand the question, converting multilingual inputs into English to facilitate the task-solving phase. In the intermediate layers, LLMs engage in problem-solving by thinking in English and incorporating multilingual knowledge to obtain factual content, leveraging the self-attention and feed-forward structures, respectively. In the last several layers, LLMs generate responses that align with the original language of the query. In addition, we investigate the existence of language-specific neurons when processing a certain language. To detect neurons activated by the input language, even without labels, we innovatively design a Parallel Language specific Neuron Detection (PLND) method that effectively measures the significance of neurons when handling multilingual inputs. By comprehensive ablation analysis through deactivating neurons of different layers and structures, we verify the framework that we propose. Additionally, we demonstrate that we can utilize such a framework to effectively enhance the multilingual ability with much less training effort.1\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as PaLM Chowdhery et al. (2022), GPT-4 OpenAI (2023), LLaMA Touvron et al. (2023), and Mistral Jiang et al. (2023) have dramatically transformed traditional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, integrating seamlessly into daily and professional uses. Thanks to their extensive pretraining on massive corpora mixed with different languages, these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating text across multiple languages Huang et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023); Zhao et al. (2024). Despite their proven effectiveness, the intricate workings of their multilingual processing mechanisms remain largely unclear, which leads to an important research question: _How do large language models handle multilingual?_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Some studies explore the multilingual capabilities of language models, focusing on their cross-lingual performance or structural commonalities between languages K et al. (2020); Doddapaneni et al. (2021); Chai et al. (2022). More recently, to understand the relation of certain abilities with specific model architecture especially the dominant Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017) architecture, studies such as Hou et al. (2023); Stolfo et al. (2023); Friedman et al. (2023) explore the reasoning abilities of LLMs with self-attention layers. While others like Geva et al. (2021); Dai et al. (2022); Meng et al. (2022) focus on the feed-forward layers, regarding them as key-value memories for storing factual knowledge. However, these works often examine components in isolation and lack a comprehensive framework that encompasses the entire end-to-end process. More importantly, the working mechanism of multilingualism is largely unaddressed in these interpretations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this study, to gain an initial understanding of the multilingual mechanisms within LLMs, we analyze the decoded embeddings after each layer when processing inputs in various languages other than English. We then classify these embeddings as corresponding to either English or non-English tokens (see details in Appendix A). As illustrated in Figure 1, the models initially represent non-English user instructions in non-English form. However, asthe instructions are processed through the layers of the model, the representation surprisingly becomes English-centric. In the final layers, we observe a reversion to a predominance of non-English embeddings, as the initial instructions are posted in non-English languages. This pattern suggests a complex interplay between languages within LLMs, as they negotiate between instruction fidelity and a possible English-oriented processing bias.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Motivated by these observations, we propose a new framework shown in Figure 2 that conceptualizes the operational stages of LLMs when processing multilingual inputs: In the first several layers, LLMs _understand_ the user input and convert the diverse linguistic features into a unified representation. Transitioning into the _task-solving_ phase, LLMs engage in solving the tasks by thinking in English and incorporating multilingual knowledge to obtain factual contents, leveraging the self-attention and feed-forward structures, respectively. Finally, models _generate_ responses that align with the original language of the query. Such a framework echoes the observations we have above and also some findings in previous studies, and thus reveals the LLMs\' ability to shift among languages, allowing them to comprehend, reason, and respond effectively to multilingual tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The subsequent question that arises is whether LLMs engage all available neurons of certain components or only a particular subset when processing a single language, which essentially investigates the presence of "language-specific neurons". To tackle this question, it is crucial to pinpoint which neurons are activated by the input, even without explicit labels of certain tasks. Therefore, we further develop a novel approach called Parallel Language-specific Neuron Detection (PLND), which effectively measures the significance of individual neurons in relation to the input provided. With PLND, we can identify language-specific neurons by feeding free text corpus of that language into the model and isolating neurons that consistently activate in responses. Experimental results show that by deactivating language-specific neurons which account for only \\(0.13\\%\\) of all neurons, LLMs\' performance on a summarization task could drop by \\(99\\%\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'With the proposed PLND method, we then conduct extensive experiments to validate our hypothesis illustrated in Figure 2. We selectively disable neuron groups to study their effect on LLM multilingualism. Notably, deactivating the language-specific neurons in the understanding layer leaves English XQuAD performance stable but decreases non-English performance by \\(14\\%\\). Other tasks including reasoning, knowledge question answering and NLG also exhibit the same characteristics. Moreover, enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs can be achieved by fine-tuning language-specific neurons with merely \\(200\\) contextual examples. This method results in a substantial increase in model performance, with a \\(7.4\\%\\) relative improvement on the XQuAD and an \\(8.9\\%\\) enhancement on XSum, reducing the size of the required training dataset significantly.\n' +

We denote the input of \\(i\\)-th layer in Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as \\(h_{i}\\), with the corresponding output represented as \\(h_{i+1}=T_{i}(h_{i})\\), where \\(T_{i}\\) represents the parameters of the \\(i\\)-th layer. For a specific neuron, denoted as \\(N_{k}^{(i)}\\), within the \\(i\\)-th layer--whether located in the attention or feed-forward layer--the importance is quantified as the difference between output when \\(N_{k}^{(i)}\\) is either activated or deactivated. Formally, it is defined as\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\text{Imp}(N_{k}^{(i)}|h_{i})=\\|T_{i}\\backslash N_{k}^{(i)}(h_{i})-T_{i}(h_{i })\\|_{2}, \\tag{1}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(T_{i}\\backslash N_{k}(\\cdot)\\) denotes deactivating \\(N_{k}^{(i)}\\) in \\(T_{i}\\). Then, with a set of the corpus in the specific language, denoted as \\(\\mathcal{C}=\\{c_{1},\\cdots,c_{l},\\cdots,c_{n}\\}\\), we can calculate the importance of each neuron in each layer to each corpus. Furthermore, we can select neurons that are important to all corpus in \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), i.e.,\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Feed-Forward LayerIn Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023), the \\(\\text{FFN}(x)\\) is defined as\n' +

We denote hidden embedding before \\(W_{down}\\) as \\(h_{\\text{ffn}}\\). When deactivating the \\(k\\)-th neuron of \\(W_{up}\\),\n' +

      '\\[\\begin{split}&\\text{Imp}(W_{up}[:,k]|x)=\\|\\text{FFN}(x)-\\text{FFN}(x )\\|_{2}\\\\ &=\\Big{\\|}\\big{(}h_{\\text{ffn}}\\cdot\\texttt{Mask}[k]\\big{)}W_{ down}(x)\\Big{\\|}_{2},\\end{split} \\tag{4}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(\\texttt{Mask}[k]\\) is a vector of length \\(d_{inter}\\) with the \\(k\\)-th element as \\(1\\) and others as \\(0\\). For calculating \\(\\text{Imp}(W_{up}[:,k]|x)\\) for all neurons in \\(W_{up}\\) parallelly, we introduce a diagonal mask matrix of size \\((d_{inter},d_{inter})\\), denoted as Mask. Therefore,\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\text{Imp}(W_{up}|x)=\\|(h_{\\text{ffn}}\\cdot\\texttt{Mask})W_{down}(x)\\|_{2}. \\tag{5}\\]\n' +

      'Furthermore, we find that deactivating the \\(k\\)-th neuron of \\(W_{down}\\) is equivalent to deactivating the \\(k\\)-th neuron in \\(W_{up}\\) as they all set \\(h_{\\text{ffn}}[k]=0\\). Therefore \\(\\text{Imp}(W_{down}|x)\\) can be obtain by Equation (5).\n' +

      'Self-Attention LayerFor the input \\(x\\) of length \\(l\\), the self-attention layer is defined as\n' +

      '## 3 Investigate Language-Specific Neurons\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we apply the PLND method to selected languages and models in order to confirm the existence of language-specific neurons and investigate the relationships between languages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Experimental Setup\n' +
      '\n' +
      'ModelsWe test two open-source models that perform well on multilingual tasks, including _Vicuna-7b-v1.5_Chiang et al. (2023) and _Mistral-7b-v1.0_Jiang et al. (2023). Vicuna-7b-v1.5 is an open-source chat model fine-tuned on top of LlaMa 2 Touvron et al. (2023) via instruction fine-tuning and has shown good multilingual instruction following ability.3 Mistral-7b-v1.0 is fine-tuned on Mistral-7b. For simplicity, we abbreviate them as Vicuna and Mistral hereafter to represent the two models respectively.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 3: We do not directly utilize Llama2-chat as it does not follow multilingual instructions, consistently responding in English regardless of the language of the query.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'LanguagesWe adopt \\(6\\) languages including English (En), German (De), French (Fr), Chinese (Zh), Spanish (Es), and Russian (Ru). These languages were selected because their training corpora represent over \\(0.1\\%\\) of the total pre-training data for Llama2. Furthermore, both Vicuna and Mistral are designed to tackle problems across these languages effectively, and their performance in these languages is much higher than in other low-resource languages such as Thai, Swahili, and Greek.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'CorpusTo compile a language-specific corpus without task-specific considerations, we utilize OSCAR Caswell et al. (2020) corpus which contains web crawling texts for each language. Our selection criterion for the number of contexts is based on achieving substantial coverage of each language\'s vocabulary, ensuring that the selected contexts provide a representative sample of the language. Details are shown in Table 1, where "corpus size" indicates the number of contexts selected, "corpus vocab" represents the vocabulary coverage within the selected contexts, "vocab size" refers to the number of vocabularies of that language.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Existence of Language-Specific Neurons\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Using PLND, we feed a corpus in a specific language to LLMs and identify the neurons that are consistently activated. These language-specific neurons are responsible for processing queries in that language. To ascertain whether these neurons are genuinely language-specific, we assess the performance of LLMs in corresponding languages when these neurons are deactivated versus when the same number of randomly sampled neurons is deactivated. We utilize the summarization task with XLSum dataset Hasan et al. (2021) to showcase the capabilities of LLMs, aiming to demonstrate that the resulting output can be devoid of meaning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Table 2 demonstrates the decline of multilingual capabilities when deactivating language-specific neurons. Although just deactivating around \\(0.13\\%\\) neurons, LLMs lose multilingual capabilities including understanding multilingual inputs, handling multilingual questions, and generating multilingual outputs. In contrast, deactivating the same number of randomly selected neurons does not yield any difference. Therefore, the detected neurons are language-specific and related to handling corresponding multilingual inputs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Interrelation of Language-Specific Neurons Across Languages\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Using neurons identified by PLND, we investigate the relationships of two languages via the degree of overlap between their language-specific neurons:\n' +

      '\n' +
      'DatasetTo comprehensively understand how LLMs work with different abilities, we employ four different kinds of tasks including MGSM Shi et al. (2022) for reasoning task, XQuAD Artetxe et al. (2020) for NLU task, XLSum Hasan et al. (2021) for NLG task, and X-CSQA Lin et al. (2021) for knowledge question answering task. For XL-Sum, we randomly sample \\(500\\) data points from the whole test set for each language, while for other tasks, we employ the whole test set.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Experiment DetailsFor reasoning, NLU, and knowledge question answering tasks, we adopt accuracy as the metric. As for the NLG tasks, we adopt ROUGE-L as the metric. Furthermore, for the concrete numbers of different layers, we tune hyperparameters by XQuAD in Chinese. Details are explained in Appendix B.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'NotationsTables 4 to 7 present the results of deactivating certain neurons, where "Under" denotes the understanding layers, "S-ATTN" and "S-FFN" correspond to the self-attention and the feed-forward within the task-solving layers respectively, "Gen" refers to the generation layers. The term "Random" is used to describe deactivating randomly chosen neurons, whereas "Lang-Spec" refers to the deactivation of language-specific neurons. We also present the gap between the original performance and performance after deactivation for English (\\(\\Delta_{\\text{Eng}}\\)) and averaged non-English languages (\\(\\Delta_{\\text{n-Eng}}\\)), respectively. A single metric \\(\\Delta\\) is then introduced as \\(\\Delta_{\\text{Eng}}-\\Delta_{\\text{n-Eng}}\\), where a high value indicates such deactivation operation does not bring much impact to the English performance but lead to performance drop in non-English.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Hyper-Multilingual LLMsFrom Figure 0(b) we observe that BLOOMZ also tends to default to English as its "thinking" language. Therefore, it can support multiple languages mainly because it has the ability to understand and generate these languages while using English as the language of thinking. Additionally, Figure 4 illustrates the degree of neuron overlap among languages within both the self-attention and feed-forward structures of BLOOMZ. In contrast to the findings shown in Figure 3, there is a marked reduction in overlap, indicating that individual languages maintain a higher degree of independence and do not extensively share neurons with one another.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Bilingual LLMsWe employ Chinese Llama Cui et al. (2023), which extends existing vocabulary and incorporate secondary pre-training using Chinese data and fine-tune the model with Chinese instruction datasets. However, this intensive training can lead to a degradation in performance for languages other than Chinese. As depicted in Figure 5, Chinese predominates as the primary language for thinking processing and knowledge extraction across all languages. Consequently, the absence of language-specific neurons results in the transformation of it into a Chinese-centric LLM.\n' +

To validate this framework, we introduce a novel method for detecting language-specific neurons and conduct extensive ablation studies. These studies involve selectively deactivating various neuron sets to observe their impact on the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we refine the multilingual performance of LLMs by fine-tuning these language-specific neurons, which only take up a small part of the neurons.\n' +

We denote \\(\\mathcal{U}=\\{1,\\cdots,N_{1}\\}\\) as the set of layers that take charge of understanding as shown in Figure 2.
