      '\n' +
      'Large language models are commonly trained on a mixture of filtered web data and curated "high-quality" corpora, such as social media conversations, books, or technical papers. This curation process is believed to be necessary to produce performant models with broad zero-shot generalization abilities. However, as larger models requiring pretraining on trillions of tokens are considered, it is unclear how scalable is curation and whether we will run out of unique high-quality data soon. At variance with previous beliefs, we show that properly filtered and deduplicated web data alone can lead to powerful models; even significantly outperforming models from the state-of-the-art trained on The Pile. Despite extensive filtering, the high-quality data we extract from the web is still plentiful, and we are able to obtain five trillion tokens from CommonCrawl. We publicly release an extract of 600 billion tokens from our RefinedWeb dataset, and 1.3/7.5B parameters language models trained on it*.\n' +

      'Pretraining data for large language models.Early large language models identified the importance of datasets with long, coherent documents (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Moving on from the previously used sentence-wise datasets (Chelba et al., 2013), they instead leveraged document-focused, single-domain corpora like Wikipedia or BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015). As models increased in scale, datasets based on massive web-scrape gained prevalence (Ortiz Suarez et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020). However, further work argued that these untargeted web scrape fell short of human-curated data (Radford et al., 2019), leading to the wide adoption of curated datasets such as The Pile (Gao et al., 2020), which combine web data with books, technical articles, and social media conversations. At scale, it has been proposed to emulate the human curation process by leveraging weak signals: for instance, by crawling the top links of a forum (Gokaslan et al., 2019). Targeted corpora can also produce domain-specific models (Beltagy et al., 2019), or broaden the expressiveness of models (e.g., for conversational modalities Adiwardana et al. (2020); Thoppilan et al. (2022)). Latest large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022) are trained on giant aggregated corpora, combining both massive web-scrape and so-called "high-quality" curated single-domain sources (e.g., news, books, technical papers, social media conversations). These targeted sources are often upsampled-from one to five times is most common-to increase their representation in the final dataset. The diversity and "higher-quality" brought fourth by these aggregated datasets is thought to be central to model quality; web data alone is considered insufficient to train powerful large language models (Liu et al., 2019; Scao et al., 2022).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Pipelines for web data.Massive web datasets are typically built upon CommonCrawl, a publicly available scrape of the internet, which has now been running for 12 years and has collected petabytes of data. Working with data scraped from all over the internet presents unique challenges: notably, a significant portion is low-quality machine-generated spam or pornographic content (Trinh and Le, 2018; Kreutzer et al., 2022). Accordingly, training on unfiltered web data is undesirable, resulting in poorly performing models (Raffel et al., 2020). Modern pipelines focus on filtering out this undesirable content (Wenzek et al., 2020). Broadly speaking, these pipelines usually combine a variety of stages: (1) _language identification_, leveraging inexpensive n-gram models (e.g., fastText Joulin et al. (2016)); (2) _filtering rules and heuristics_, such as only keeping lines with valid punctuation, discarding lines with too many symbols, or removing documents containing banned words (Grave et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020); (3) _ML-based quality filtering_, using lightweight models trained on known gold data to identify similar high-quality web documents (Wenzek et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020); (4) _deduplication_, removing either exact duplicate spans or similar documents (Lee et al., 2022). While some filtering is necessary, excessive filtering can introduce undesirable biases in the model. This can overly impact minorities (Dodge et al., 2021), motivating the adoption of practices such as pseudo-crawling, wherein allowed URLs are manually curated (Laurencon et al., 2022).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Deduplication.Deduplication removes repeated extracts and documents from a dataset: these could either be exact matches, identical in every character, or approximate matches, based on some similarity metric. For exact duplicates, it is common to match exact substrings of a minimum length using suffix arrays (Manber and Myers, 1993). For fuzzy duplicates, methods based on locally-sensitive hashes such as MinHash (Broder, 1997) or SimHash (Charikar, 2002) have been adopted for the pretraining data of large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021). Recently, Abbas et al. (2023) has proposed to leverage embeddings from pretrained models to imbune semantic understanding in approximate matching algorithms. Deduplication has been identified as playing a significant role in improving language models (Allamanis, 2019; Lee et al., 2022). Notably, it reduces memorization (Carlini et al., 2022), which is especially problematic in large models (Carlini et al., 2021). Furthermore, repeated data has been shown to be increasingly harmful to model quality as parameter count increases (Hernandez et al., 2022): for a 1B parameters model, a hundred duplicates are harmful; at 175B, even a few duplicates could have a disproportionate effect. Concurrently to this work, the Pythia suite of models found that deduplicating The Pile had a limited impact on zero-shot performance (Biderman et al., 2023), questioning whether deduplication is as relevant for curated corpora as it for predominantly web-based datasets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We provide an overview of some widely adopted existing pretraining English datasets for LLMs in Table 1, with additional information in Table 12 of Appendix F.3. We also note that recent popular open models (Zhang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023) often indirectly leverage The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) by doing a mix-and-match of its components.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Focusing on building a large-scale high-quality web pretraining dataset, we extend upon the state-of-the-art in three ways: (1) we aggregate and combine best-practices for document preparation and filtering across multiple pipelines, and introduce line-wise corrections; (2) we combine both exact and fuzzy deduplication at very large-scale; (3) the scale of our final dataset is unique, with a total 5,000 billion tokens, and a 600 billion tokens extract available for public use with permissive licensing. Training large models on RefinedWeb also lead us to challenge the commonly held belief that web data is strictly worse than curated corpora.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Macrodata Refinement and RefinedWeb\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We introduce **MDR** (MacroData Refinement), a pipeline for filtering and deduplicating web data from CommonCrawl at very large scale. Using MDR, we produce RefinedWerb, an English pretraining dataset of five trillion tokens based on web data only. We leverage strict filtering and stringent deduplication to uplift the quality of web data, distilling it down to a corpus matching the quality of aggregated corpora used to train state-of-the-art models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Design principles.We abide by the following guidelines:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Scale first.** We intend MDR to produce datasets to be used to train 40-200B parameters models, thus requiring trillions of tokens (Hoffmann et al., 2022). For English-only RefinedWeb, we target a size of 3-6 trillion tokens. Specifically, we eschew any labour intensive human curation process, and focus on CommonCrawl instead of disparate single-domain sources.\n' +
      '* **Strict deduplication.** Inspired by the work of Lee et al. (2022), which demonstrated the value of deduplication for large language models, we implement a rigorous deduplication pipeline. We combine both exact and fuzzy deduplication, and use strict settings leading to removal rates far higher than others have reported.\n' +
      '* **Neutral filtering.** To avoid introducing further undesirable biases into the model (Dodge et al., 2021; Welbl et al., 2021), we avoid using ML-based filtering outside of language identification. We stick to simple rules and heuristics, and use only URL filtering for adult content.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Table 2 and Figure 2 outline the full MDR pipeline.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Document preparation: reading data, filtering URLs, extracting text, and language identification\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Reading the data.CommonCrawl is available in either WARC (raw HTML response), or WET files (preprocessed to only include plain text). Individual files correspond to a page at a given URL; these constitute single documents/samples. Working with WET files would spare us from running our own HTML extraction; however, in line with previous works (Gao et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021), we found WET files to include undesirable navigation menus, ads, and other irrelevant texts. Accordingly, our pipeline starts from raw WARC files, read with the wavcio library.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'URL filtering.Before undertaking any compute-heavy processing, we perform a first filtering based on the URL alone. This targets fraudulent and/or adult websites (e.g., predominantly pornographic, violent, related to gambling, etc.). We base our filtering on two rules: (1) an aggregated blocklist of 4.6M domains; (2) a URL score, based on the presence of words from a list we curated and weighed by severity. We found that commonly used blocklists include many false positives, such as popular blogging platforms or even pop culture websites. Furthermore, word-based rules (like the one used in C4, Raffel et al. (2020)) can easily result in medical and legal pages being blocked. Our final detailed rules based on this investigation are shared in Appendix G.1. Since we intend RefinedWeb to be used as part of an aggregate dataset along with curated corpora, we also filtered common sources of high-quality data: Wikipedia, arXiv, etc. The detailed list is available in Appendix G.1.3.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2: **Subsequent stages of Macrodata Refinement remove nearly 90% of the documents originally in CommonCrawl.** Notably, filtering and deduplication each result in a halving of the data available: around 50% of documents are discarded for not being English, 24% of remaining for being of insufficient quality, and 12% for being duplicates. We report removal rate (grey) with respect to each previous stage, and kept rate (shade) overall. Rates measured in % of documents in the document preparation phase, then in tokens.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Text extraction.We want to extract only the main content of the page, ignoring menus, headers, footers, and ads among others: Lopukhin (2019) found that trafilatura (Barbaresi, 2021) was the best non-commercial library for retrieving content from blog posts and news articles. Although this is only a narrow subset of the kind of pages making up CommonCrawl, we found this finding to hold more broadly. We use trafilatura for text extraction, and apply extra formatting via regular expressions: we limit new lines to two consecutive ones, and remove all URLs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Language identification.We use the fastText language classifier of CCNet (Wenzek et al., 2020) at the document-level: it uses characters n-gram and was trained on Wikipedia, supporting 176 languages. We remove documents for which the top language scores below 0.65: this usually corresponds to pages without any natural text. For this paper, we focus on English; RefinedWeb can also be derived for other languages, see Appendix D for details.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The data we retrieve at this stage, called RW-Raw, corresponds to what we can extract with the minimal amount of filtering. At this stage, only 48% of the original documents are left, mostly filtered out by language identification.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Filtering: document-wise and line-wise\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Repetition removal.Due to crawling errors and low-quality sources, many documents contain repeated sequences: this may cause pathological behavior in the final model (Holtzman et al., 2019). We could catch this content at the later deduplication stage, but it is cheaper and easier to catch it document-wise early on. We implement the heuristics of Rae et al. (2021), and remove any document with excessive line, paragraph, or n-gram repetitions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Document-wise filtering.A significant fraction of pages are machine-generated spam, made predominantly of lists of keywords, boilerplate text, or sequences of special characters. Such documents are not suitable for language modeling; to filter them out, we adopt the quality filtering heuristics of Rae et al. (2021). These focus on removing outliers in terms of overall length, symbol-to-word ratio, and other criteria ensuring the document is actual natural language. We note that these filters have to be adapted on a per language basis, as they may result in overfitting if naively transferred from English to other languages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Line-wise corrections.Despite the improvements brought forth by using trafilatura instead of relying on preprocessed files, many documents remain interlaced with undesirable lines (e.g., social media counters 3 likes, navigation buttons). Accordingly, we devised a line-correction filter, targeting these undesirable items. If these corrections remove more than 5% of a document, we remove it entirely. See Appendix G.2 for details.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The data we retrieve at this stage has gone through all of the filtering heuristics in the MDR pipeline. We refer to this dataset as RW-Filtered. Only 23% of the documents of CommonCrawl are left, with around 50% of the documents of RW-Raw removed by the filtering.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Deduplication: fuzzy, exact, and across dumps\n' +
      '\n' +
      'After filtering, although data quality has improved, a large fraction of the content is repeated across documents. This may be due to the crawler indirectly hitting the same page multiple times, to boilerplate content being repeated (e.g., licences), or even to plagiarism. These duplicates can strongly impact models, favoring memorization instead of generalization (Lee et al., 2022; Hernandez et al., 2022). Since deduplication is expensive, it has seen limited adoption in public datasets (Ortiz Suarez et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020). We adopt an aggressive deduplication strategy, combining both fuzzy document matches and exact sequences removal.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fuzzy deduplication.We remove similar documents by applying MinHash (Broder, 1997): for each document, we compute a sketch and measure its approximate similarity with other documents, eventually removing pairs with high overlap. MinHash excels at finding templated documents: licenses with only specific entities differing, placeholder SEO text repeated across websites-see examples of the\n' +

      '\n' +
      'biggest clusters in Appendix H.1. We perform MinHash deduplication using 9,000 hashes per document, calculated over 5-grams and divided into 20 buckets of 450 hashes. We found that using less aggressive settings, such as the 10 hashes of The Pile (Gao et al., 2020), resulted in lower deduplication rates and worsened model performance. See Appendix G.3.1 for more details about our MinHash setup.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Exact deduplication.Exact substring operates at the sequence-level instead of the document-level, finding matches between strings that are exact token-by-token matches by using a suffix array (Manber and Myers, 1993) (e.g., specific disclaimers or notices, which may not compromise the entire document as showcased in Appendix H.2). We remove any match of more than 50 consecutive tokens, using the implementation of Lee et al. (2022). We note that exact substring alters documents, by removing specific spans: we also experimented with dropping entire documents or loss-masking the duplicated strings instead of cutting them, but this didn\'t result in significant changes in zero-shot performance-see Appendix G.3.2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'URL deduplication.Because of computational constraints, it is impossible for us to perform deduplication directly on RW-Filtered. Instead, we split CommonCrawl into 100 parts, where each part contains a hundredth of each dump, and perform deduplication on individual parts. Most of the larger duplicate clusters (e.g., licences, common spams) will be shared across parts, and effectively removed. However, we found that CommonCrawl dumps had significant overlap, with URLs being revisited across dumps despite no change in content. Accordingly, we keep a list of the URLs of all samples we have kept from each part, and remove them from subsequent parts being processed.\n' +

      'We now validate that RefinedWeb can be used to train powerful models, matching the zero-shot performance obtained with curated corpora and state-of-the-art language models. We first discuss our evaluation and pretraining setup, and models with which we compare. We perform experiments at small scale to internally compare with other popular datasets, and ablate the three main stages of RefinedWeb (raw, filtered, final). Then, we scale to 1B and 7B models trained on 350GT to compare with state-of-the-art models. Finally, we apply the MDR pipeline to existing pretraining datasets, and show that it can potentially deliver further improvements.\n' +

      'Evaluation.At variance with previous works studying pretraining datasets (Rae et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2022), we focus our evaluation on zero-shot generalization across many tasks rather than measuring validation loss. Perplexity alone can be at odds with end-task performance (Tay et al., 2021), and modern works on LLMs predominantly report zero-shot performance (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022). Furthermore, zero-shot generalization is the "natural" setting for autoregressive decoder-only models, in which they perform best (Wang et al., 2022). Our evaluation setup is inspired by the one used by the architecture and scaling group of Big Science (Scao et al., 2022).\n' +

      '**Models.** We train 1B, 3B, and 7B parameters autoregressive decoder-only models, based on configurations and hyperparameters similar to GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), diverging mostly on our use of ALiBi (Press et al., 2021). We use FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) in a custom codebase. We train internal models on both The Pile and RefinedWeb to control for deviations caused by our pretraining setup-we found The Pile models to perform in-line with others.

Note that we do not compare against the recently introduced LLaMA models (Touvron et al., 2023), as the smallest of them is trained on x2.5 more compute than our largest model, preventing a meaningful comparison from being made dataset-wise.

      '### Can web data alone outperform curated corpora?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We endeavour to demonstrate that web data alone can result in models outperforming other models trained on curated corpora. To do so, we first perform a small-scale study with 1B and 3B parameters models trained to optimality (27GT and 60GT) on popular web and curated datasets. Then, we scale up to 1B and 7B models trained on 350GT, and compare zero-shot generalization to state-of-the-art models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Small-scale study.We first consider popular public web datasets (OSCAR-2019 (Ortiz Suarez et al., 2019), OSCAR-2022 (Abadji et al., 2021), C4 (Raffel et al., 2020)), The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) as the most popular publicly available curated dataset, and variations of RefinedWeb (RW-Raw, RW-Filtered, and RW as described in Section 3). For this first study, all models are trained with the same architecture and the same internal codebase; they are also all evaluated within the same framework-only pretraining datasets differ.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Results averaged on the small-=+ aggregate of 6 tasks are presented in Table 4. We observe relatively strong performance of all web datasets compared to The Pile, showcasing that curation is not a silver bullet for performant language models. We find C4 to be a strong pretraining dataset, in line with the findings of Scao et al. (2022)-however, The Pile comparatively underperforms more in our benchmarks. The relatively disappointing results on OSCAR-22.01 may be due to the main version of the dataset being distributed without deduplication. Regarding RefinedWeb, both filtering and deduplication significantly improve performance.\n' +

Average accuracy in zero-shot on the small-agg aggregate. All models trained with identical architectures and pretraining hyperparameters. We find that OSCAR-22.01 underperforms other datasets signficantly, perhaps because deduplication is only optional. C4 is a strong baseline, with OSCAR-21.09 lagging slightly behind, but we find that RefinedWeb outperforms both web datasets and the most popular curated dataset, The Pile.

      'Results on main-agg are presented in Figure 1, and in Figure 3 for core-agg and ext-agg. We find that open models consistently underperform models trained on private curated corpora, such as GPT-3-even when using a similar evaluation setup. Conversely, models trained on RefinedWeb are able to match the performance of the GPT-3 series using web data alone, even though common high-quality sources used in The Pile are excluded from RefinedWeb (see Table 14 in Appendix). Finally, we note that our internal model trained on The Pile performs in line with the BigScience Architecture and Scaling model; this highlights that our pretraining setup is unlikely to be the main source of increased performance for models trained on RefinedWeb.\n' +

      '### Do other corpora benefit from MDR?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Ablating the contributions and evaluating the performance of individual components in the MDR pipeline is difficult: for most heuristics, there is no agreed-upon ground truth, and changes may be too insignificant to result in sufficient zero-shot signal after pretraining. In the first half of Section 4.2, we identified that subsequent stages of RefinedWeb (raw, filtered, final) led to improvements in performance. In this section, we propose to apply independently the filtering and deduplication stages of MDR to popular pretraining datasets, studying whether they generalize widely.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We report results on the small-agg in Table 5. First, we find that improvements from filtering are not systematic. On The Pile, we had to adjust our line length and characters ratio heuristics to avoid expunging books and code. Despite improvements on OSCAR-21.09, C4, and The Pile, our filters worsen performance on OSCAR-22.01; generally, removal rates from filtering do not seem strongly correlated with downstream accuracy. Conversely, deduplication delivers a steady boost across all datasets, and removal rates are better correlated with changes in performance. We find OSCAR-21.09 and C4 to be already well deduplicated, while The Pile and OSCAR-22.01 exhibit 40-60% duplicates. The base version of OSCAR-22.01 is distributed without deduplication; for The Pile, this is consistent with the findings of Zhang et al. (2022). Finally, combining filtering and deduplication results in further improvements; interestingly, although performance is now more uniform across datasets, differences remain, suggesting that flaws in the original text extraction and processing can\'t be fully compensated for.\n' +

      'Figure 3: **Models trained on \\(\\blacktriangled\\) RefinedWeb alone outperform models trained on curated corpora.** Zero-shot performance averaged on our core-agg (left) and ext-agg (right) task aggregates (see Section 4.1 for details, and Figure 1 for results on main-agg). Existing open models fail to match the performance of the original GPT-3 series (left); however, models trained on RefinedWeb significantly outperform models trained on \\(\\blacktriangled\\) The Pile: including our direct comparison model (right), ruling out our pretraining setup as the main source of increased performance. In fact, our RefinedWeb models even match the performance of the \\(\\blacksquare\\) GPT-3 models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By processing C4 through MDR, we are able to obtain subsets of data which might slightly outperform RefinedWeb; this combines both the stringent filtering of C4 (e.g., strict NSFW word blocklist, 3-sentence span deduplication) with our own filters and deduplication. While such a combination results in rejection rates that would be unacceptable for our target of 3-6 trillions tokens, this represents an interesting perspective for shorter runs, which may be able to extract extremely high-quality subsets from large web datasets.\n' +

      '## 5 Limitations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Biases.We conduct a basic analysis of the toxicity of RefinedWeb in Figure 4. We find RW to be about as toxic as The Pile, based on the definition of toxicity provided by the Perspective API: "content that is rude or disrespectful". Notably, this definition does not cover issues with social biases or harmfulness. Although it is unlikely that our pipeline introduces further issues on this side than is already documented for popular datasets, we encourage further quantitative work on the public extract of RefinedWeb.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Multiple epochs.Instead of looking for "unique" tokens to make up a trillion-scale pretraining dataset, one could simply repeat data over multiple epochs. Popular models like OPT and NeoX-20B do this for up to 2 epochs, and most curated datasets upsample corpora 2-5 times. However, Hernandez et al. (2022) has recently shown that models with 100B+ parameters may be sensitive to even just a few epochs. Orthogonal to our work lies a line of research exploring tradeoffs in the data-constrained regime: can deduplication help sustain more epochs? Are multiple epochs on higher quality data better than a one epoch on lower quality data? See Appendix E.3 for a more in-depth discussion.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Other results on deduplication.**Biderman et al. (2023) found a limited impact on zero-shot performance from deduplicating The Pile; we discuss further in Appendix F.2, but encourage further deduplication research on curated corpora, and studying deduplication in the data-constrained regime, where multiple epochs have to be performed to compensate for the reduction in tokens incurred by deduplication.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 6 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As LLMs are widely adopted, models trained past the recommendations of scaling laws are bound to become increasingly common to amortize inference costs (Touvron et al., 2023). This will further drive the need for pretraining datasets with trillions of tokens, an order of magnitude beyond publicly available corpora. We have demonstrated that stringent filtering and deduplication could result in a five trillion tokens web only dataset suitable to produce models competitive with the state-of-the-art, even outperforming LLMs trained on curated corpora. We publicly release a 600GT extract of RefinedWeb, and note that RefinedWeb has already been used to train state-of-the-art language models, such as Falcon-40B (Almazrouei et al., 2023).\n' +

After this first preprocessing stage, we filter data using heuristics from MassiveWeb (Rae et al., 2021) and our own line-wise corrections (Appendix G.2). Finally, we run extensive deduplication, removing URLs revisited across dumps (Section 3.3) and performing subsequently fuzzy and exact substring deduplication, with each stage drawing from Lee et al.

      '\n' +
      'Multilingual data.Using the language identification filter, we classify processed CommonCrawl data into 176 languages. Figure 6 shows the top 20 languages present in the data _excluding English_, based on their relative contribution in descending order. 58.20% of all documents in the processed CommonCrawl data were identified as English. We find the distribution of languages in CommonCrawl to only be partially aligned with the worldwide distribution of language speakers (Eberhard et al., 2023): Russian is over-represented (2nd in CC but only 8th worldwide), Mandarin Chinese is under-represented (6-7th in CC but 2nd worldwide), and Hindi does not show-up in the top 20 despite being the 3rd most spoken.\n' +

      'Processing multilingual data.The MDR pipeline can be used to process all languages: features such as text extraction are language-agnostic, whereas specific filters such as line-wise corrections need to typically be tuned for each individual language.

      'Figure 5: **Make-up of RefinedWeb in document lengths (left) and top domains (right).** (a) We find the OSCAR datasets and RW-Raw to have similar document length distributions; following filtering, most of the short documents are discarded from RW-Filtered. As deduplication removes spans, it reintroduces shorter documents to RefinedWeb. We note the make-up of C4 and RefinedWeb to be relatively similar, with a longer tail of short documents for RefinedWeb. Finally, The File exhibit a unique make-up, with a long tail of both long (books, etc.) and short documents. (b) Top domains in RefinedWeb span from popular content platforms (Blogspot, WordPress, Tumblr, etc.), to news websites (CNN, New York Times, etc.), and include also technical content such as BioMed Central or Springer.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '* **MinHash alone is insufficient**, as it doesn\'t match the zero-shot performance of exact deduplication. Conversely, combining it with exact deduplication doesn\'t improve performance further.\n' +
      '* **Masking spanned duplicates degrades performance**, systematically underperforming other approaches. Dropping and cutting spans perform similarly, although it\'s likely that dropping documents slightly outperforms cutting.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Finally, we chose to apply MinHash before exact deduplication, as it is easier to scale: approximate deduplication acts as a pruning phase, enabling us to scale deduplication further. Finally, we choose the common option of cutting spans, as dropping resulted in even more stringent rejection rates which would have compromised our ability to collect 5 trillion tokens.\n' +

      'Along with our aggregates, we also evaluated perplexity on Wikitext (Table 9). We found that models trained on RefinedWeb achieve performance close to that of models trained on The Pile. Importantly, we note that RefinedWeb does not contain any content from Wikipedia - it is explicitly filtered out at the URL level. We believe this accounts for most of the difference in perplexity, as RW models may not be familiar with the idiosyncrasies of Wikitext (e.g., layout of an article, etc.)\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Earlier in this work, we outlined that to scale pretraining data, practitioners had two choices: (1) improve data collection, which is the avenue we chose to pursue; (2) train models on multiple epochs of the same data. Due to current uncertainties in the ability of larger models to sustain multiple epochs without adverse effects (Hernandez et al., 2022), we focused on (1). A fairly rational question regarding (2) is whether deduplication may improve the situation, and whether deduplicated data may be able to sustain more epochs without compromising model quality.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We train 1B parameters models on 30GT of RW and RW-Filtered. We keep the number of pretraining tokens fixed, but train for 1, 5, 25, and 100 epochs. This is a small-scale, limited set-up, which would have to be improved to obtain definitive results. We plot the degradation in performance compared to a single epoch in Figure 7(a) and the gap between RW and RW-F in Figure 7(b). We find that the absolute degradation is less important for RefinedWeb than for RefinedWeb-Filtered; furthermore, the gap widens with increasing number of epochs. However, we observe significant variability across tasks.\n' +

The higher end of this improvement is broadly in line with our findings in Table 5. Nevertheless, a difference in our findings and theirs remain. We posit a few possible hypotheses:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Differences between curated and web data.** It is possible that web data is more sensitive to duplicates. For instance, the most common duplicates in web data (e.g., spam) may be more detrimental than the most common duplicates in curated data. This suggests a qualitative component to deduplication that we have not studied in this work.\n' +
      '* **Differences in deduplication pipeline.** Because Biderman et al. (2023) uses the MinHash settings from Lee et al. (2022), they are mostly identical to ours. However, we also apply exact deduplication: while their deduplication incurs a 30% reduction in size, our deduplication is more aggressive, resulting in a 45% reduction in size. This may explain why our results in Table 5 show a stronger gain from deduplication than theirs in Figure 9.\n' +
      '* **Differences in pretraining.** Finally, we note that Biderman et al. (2023) chooses to perform a partial extra epoch on the deduplicated data to reach 300GT, while we always perform a single epoch. Their setting corresponds to a data-constrained scenario, which is more realistic for the curated data they study; for us, web data is plentiful, so deduplication never truly limits the size of the datasets we can use.\n' +

This design choice was motivated by: (1) challenges in avoiding overfiltering content from minorities when using ML-based classifiers on the content of documents (Welbl et al., 2021); (2) NSFW words block-list applied on content (such as the one used in C4) also resulting in overfiltering of legal and medical content (Dodge et al., 2021).\n' +

      'Our URL filtering focuses on finding domains that are related to adult content, that may be harmful to users, or that are very likely to contain mostly unstructured text/spam (e.g., file hosting websites). First, we aggregated a list of 4.6M domains, detailed in Appendix G.1.1, that we explicitly ban; then, we built a simple URL scoring system, based on matching subwords in the URL against a list of words we curated (see Appendix G.1.2). We curated this list of words based on manual inspection, cross-referencing results with pages surfaced by ToxicBERT as being outliers in toxicity (Hanu and Unitary team, 2020).\n' +

      'We employ MinHash to find approximate duplicate documents in our web corpora at a very large scale.

      'Signing.We start by normalizing the content to increase recall: punctuation is removed, text is lowercased, NFD Unicode normalization is applied, accents are removed, and all whitespace is normalized. We tokenize the resulting text using the GPT-2 tokenizer (Radford et al., 2019) and obtain the set of unique \\(n\\)-grams for each document. Hash functions are used to obtain a signature for each document: for each hash function, the smallest value is kept from hashing every unique \\(n\\)-gram in the document. If two documents are similar, then there is a high probability that they will have the same minimum hash (MinHash) for at least some of the hash functions used (Broder, 1997). The ratio of matching hashes between two documents approximates the Jaccard Similarity (Jaccard, 1912) of the sets of their unique \\(n\\)-grams (the sets being \\(d_{i}\\) and \\(d_{j}\\)):\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Finally, we cluster documents across all buckets -- if documents A and B match in one bucket and B and C in another, A-B-C becomes a cluster. We randomly remove all but one of the documents in each cluster.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Lee et al. (2022) also proposed filtering down on false positives by computing the real Jaccard similarity, or other metrics such as the edit similarity between identified document pairs. Given the large amount of data we have available across all of CommonCrawl, and that our main concern is improving recall, we decided to skip this additional step.\n' +

      '#### g.3.2 Exact substring deduplication\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We make use of the ExactSubstr implementation publicly released by Lee et al. (2022) for exact text matching. We apply exact substring deduplication to data that has already been deduplicated by MinHash, reducing by nearly 40% size of the dataset on which we have to operate. ExactSubstr will find long strings of text that are present, character for character, across multiple documents. Some of these may have escaped the earlier stage of approximate deduplication: they might not constitute a big enough portion of the document; one document might have repeated sections sourced across many different documents; or they may simply not have been found due to the approximate nature of MinHash.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Finding duplicates.ExactSubstr concatenates all the documents in the dataset to create a single long text sequence; then, it builds a suffix array (Manber and Myers, 1993) in linear time--an array of the indexes to a lexicographical ordering of all the suffixes in the sequence. Finally, duplicate sequences can also be found in linear time using the suffix array, by simply traversing the ordered list of suffixes and comparing the beginning of each pair of two consecutive suffixes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We apply the same normalization and tokenization as for MinHash to the content of our documents before concatenating them. One important difference is that reversibility is important: for MinHash, we were discarding entire documents, and thus never relying on the normalized+tokenized representation for downstream use. Here, once we have identified duplicate normalized+tokenized spans, we need to revert to the original span to remove it. Accordingly, we include normalization in the tokenization process, and validate that the process is reversible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'If a match is longer than 50 tokens, there will be multiple overlapping duplicated ranges. These overlapping duplicated ranges in the concatenated dataset sequence are merged before we save them to a file. We then take these ranges and retrieve the original document that produced them, obtaining the character substrings corresponding to the duplicated token ranges.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Removing duplicates.We considered applying the following transformations to the duplicate spans:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* ExactSubstr-Cut: we remove the duplicated spans, and discard documents where there are fewer than 20 non-duplicated characters left-this is the vanilla setting used by Lee et al. (2022);\n' +
      '* ExactSubstr-Mask: we loss-mask the duplicated spans, preventing a loss from being computed on the duplicated text during pretraining, and discard documents where there are fewer than 20 non-masked characters left.\n' +
      '* ExactSubstr-DropPartial: if more than 20% of the document is duplicated, we remove the entire document;\n' +
      '* ExactSubstr-DropPary: we drop any document with a duplicated span in it.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Broadly speaking, ExactSubstr-Cut might remove text mid-sentence resulting in disconnected text; ExactSubstr-Mask does not have this issue, but might be less efficient as a significant portion of the training tokens will not directly contribute to updating the model\'s weights; ExactSubstr-Drop might still keep considerable duplicated sections in its Partial version, especially on larger documents, while the Any version might be overly aggressive. Following ablations in Appendix E.1, we choose to stick with the vanilla approach, ExactSubstr-Cut.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that in all cases, while MinHash keeps one copy of the duplicated documents, our exact deduplication removes all copies of the duplicated span.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Execution environment\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Most data processing took place in large CPU clusters, with 100-250 AWS c5.18xlarge instances; each instance has 72 vCPUs and 144 GiB of memory. We usually run with 10,000-20,000 vCPUs in the cluster, enabling rapid parallel processing.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For ExactSubstr, the entire dataset being deduplicated needs to be loaded onto memory: we leveraged the AWS x2iedn instances, which come with up to 2 TiB of memory in a single instance.\n' +
